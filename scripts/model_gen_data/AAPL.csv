The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. During 2017, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 28% and 72%, respectively, of total net sales.The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products and services are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Companys retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high-quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training, and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software and other accessories that complement the Companys products.The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high-quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise, integration and support services.The Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education-related materials through iTunes U, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its retail and online stores.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 4The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its reportable segments. The Companys products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease-of-use and seamless integration into information technology environments. The Companys products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration.No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015.CompetitionThe markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. Many of the Companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features (including security features), relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive price competition, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services.The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software (iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content and applications (Digital Content and Services). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.Supply of ComponentsAlthough most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a few components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 5Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through R&D, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Total R&D expense was $11.6 billion, $10.0 billion and $8.1 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Intellectual PropertyThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Companys products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic DataDuring 2017, the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance, and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data.Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies.Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 6WarrantyThe Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In certain jurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute, typically at least two years. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products.BacklogIn the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.EmployeesAs of September 30, 2017, the Company had approximately 123,000 full-time equivalent employees.Available InformationThe Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2018, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 29% and 71%, respectively, of total net sales.The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products and services are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Companys retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high-quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training, and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software and other accessories that complement the Companys products.The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high-quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise, integration and support services.The Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education-related materials through iTunes U, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its retail and online stores.The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its reportable segments. The Companys products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease-of-use and seamless integration into information technology environments. The Companys products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration.No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016.CompetitionThe markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. Many of the Companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive price competition, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 4The Companys services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software (iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content and applications (Digital Content and Services). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.Supply of ComponentsAlthough most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through R&D, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.Intellectual PropertyThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 5The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Companys products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Companys products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic DataDuring 2018, the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. Gross margins on the Companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties.Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.WarrantyThe Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end user. The Company also offers a 90-day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In certain jurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute, typically at least two years. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products.BacklogIn the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.EmployeesAs of September 29, 2018, the Company had approximately 132,000 full-time equivalent employees.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 6Available InformationThe Companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (R&D), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.Intellectual PropertyThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Companys products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.EmployeesAs of September 28, 2019, the Company had approximately 137,000 full-time equivalent employees.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 3Available InformationThe Companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.Cloud ServicesThe Companys cloud services store and keep customers content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.Digital ContentThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store, that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.The Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple ArcadeSM, a game subscription service; Apple Music, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+SM, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+SM, which offers exclusive original content.

The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2020, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 34% and 66%, respectively, of total net sales.No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.CompetitionThe markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property.The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 2The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Companys competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Companys services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate the Companys product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.Supply of ComponentsAlthough most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace.

"Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading Business and Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Companys business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as future, anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, plans, predicts, will, would, could, can, may, and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Companys actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.Cloud ServicesThe Companys cloud services store and keep customers content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.Digital ContentThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store, that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.The Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade, a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+SM, a personalized fitness service; Apple Music, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+, which offers exclusive original content and live sports.Payment ServicesThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay, a cashless payment service.Markets and DistributionThe Companys customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.CompetitionThe markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property.The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Companys competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Companys services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Companys product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.Supply of ComponentsAlthough most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (R&D), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.Intellectual PropertyThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Companys products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.Human CapitalThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.Workplace Practices and PoliciesThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.Compensation and BenefitsThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Companys success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees individual growth and development.Inclusion and DiversityThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.EngagementThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.Health and SafetyThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. The Company has also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.Available InformationThe Companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Companys products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.Human CapitalThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.Workplace Practices and PoliciesThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.Compensation and BenefitsThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Companys success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees individual growth and development.Inclusion and DiversityThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.EngagementThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.Health and SafetyThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.Available InformationThe Companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

"Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading ""Markets and Distribution,"" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  The Company's business is subject to the risks of international operations.   A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. Historically, the Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the Company's results of operations.  40     Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  Further information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading ""Foreign Currency Risk"" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  The Company's future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers.   The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Company's products. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company's new operating system, on a timely basis or at all.  In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and results of operations.  The Company's business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company's future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.   Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms.  41     Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company's future operating results and financial condition could be adversely effected. Information regarding claims and potential litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  The Company expects its quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.   The Company's profit margins vary among its products, its geographic markets, and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part, on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that period's net sales.  The typical concentration of net sales in the third month of the Company's fiscal quarters can adversely affect the Company's business and operating results.   The Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company's ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics or components suppliers, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition.  The Company's success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.   Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Company's employees are located. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully attract and retain the key personnel it needs. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in the Company's stock price may adversely affect its ability to retain key employees. As of September 28, 2002, a substantial majority of the Company's outstanding employee stock options were out-of-the-money.  The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.   The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the  42      Company does not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost.  The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen.   The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.  The market value of the Company's non-current debt and equity investments is subject to significant volatility.   The Company holds minority investments in several public companies with a combined fair market value of approximately $39 million as of September 28, 2002. These investments are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are subject to significant volatility. The Company has categorized its investments in these companies as available-for-sale requiring the investments be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings when it is judged an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The Company has recognized material impairment charges related to its non-current debt and equity investments twice in the last two fiscal years.  The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.   Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The parliament of the European Union is working on finalizing the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive). The Directive makes producers of electrical goods, including personal computers, financially responsible for the collection, recycling, and safe disposal of past and future products. The Directive must now be approved and implemented by individual European Union governments by June 2004, while the producers' financial obligations are scheduled to start June 2005. The Company's potential liability resulting from the Directive related to past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial. However, because it is likely that specific laws, regulations, and enforcement policies will vary significantly between individual European member states, it is not currently possible to estimate the Company's existing liability or future expenses resulting from the Directive. As the European Union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with respect to the Directive, the Company will continue to assess its potential financial impact. Similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies, including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.  43      Business interruptions could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.   The Company's major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including certain major components suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. The Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster.  Unanticipated changes in the Company's tax rates could affect its future results.   The Company's future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation.  The Company's stock price may be volatile.   The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock in the future.  44         Item 7A. Disclosures About Market Risk      Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management   To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the non-hedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and option positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial position. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as of October 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income.  Interest Rate Risk   While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  The Company's fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Company's investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process.  During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004.  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of September 28, 2002, $1.087 billion of the Company's investment portfolio classified as short-term investments was invested in U.S. Agency and corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 29, 2001, $313 million of the Company's investment portfolio classified as short-term investments was in U.S. agency securities with underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 4 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. Due to liquidity needs, or in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for the purpose of duration management of the Company's  45       investment portfolio, the Company may sell investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of $7 million in 2002 and $1 million in 2001.  In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 28, 2002, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $37.7 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 29, 2001, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $17.8 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Company's policy is to hold investments to maturity.  The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program.  During the last two years, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps, which qualified as accounting hedges, generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of $6 million. During 2001 the Company closed out all of its then existing debt swap positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2001 and 2002 were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and are being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. At certain times in the past, the Company has also entered into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management.  The Company's asset swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with associated gains and losses recorded in interest and other income. Interest rate asset swaps outstanding as of September 30, 2000, had a weighted-average receive rate of 5.50% and a weighted-average pay rate of 6.66%. The unrealized loss on these assets swaps as of September 30, 2000, of $5.7 million was deferred and then recognized in income in 2001 as part of the SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment effective on October 1, 2000. The Company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during 2001 realizing a gain of $1.1 million.  Foreign Currency Risk   Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.  46     The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate of hedging instruments. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries.  In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths. The value-at-risk is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $3.8 million as of September 28, 2002 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $6.8 million as of September 29, 2001. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.  Actual gains and losses in the future associated with the Company's investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 28, 2002 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company's actual exposures and positions.  47            Item 8.

subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related personal computing and communicating solutions for sale primarily to education, creative, consumer, and business customers.  Basis of Presentation and Preparation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  Typically, the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2002 and 2001 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. Consequently, an additional week was added to the first quarter of fiscal 2000. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar.  Financial Instruments   Investments   The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company's marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.  Derivative Financial Instruments   On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to other comprehensive income of approximately $12 million, all of which was reclassified to earnings during 2001. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income.  For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or loss on the  53      derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current period.  For foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected cash flows on the hedged transactions determined as the sum of the probability-weighted outcomes with respect to the option strike rates with the total change in fair value of the option hedge. For interest rate swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133.  Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.  Property, Plant, and Equipment   Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years.  Prior to the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company had classified capitalized costs related to internal-use software on the balance sheet in other assets. Effective as of September 29, 2001, and for all other periods presented, the Company has reclassified internal-use software to property, plant, and equipment and reclassified related cash flows for the purchase or development of internal-use software from cash flow from operations to cash flow from investing activities.  54     Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments   Investments categorized as non-current debt and equity investments on the consolidated balance sheet are in equity and debt instruments of public companies. They are not categorized as current assets either because, given their nature, they are not readily convertible into cash or because they represent potentially longer-term investments by the Company. Further, the fair value of these investments has been subject to a high degree of volatility. The Company's non-current debt and equity investments have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. However, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other-than-temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and expense. Occasionally, the Company uses short-term equity derivatives to manage potential dispositions of non-current debt and equity investments. Any gains or losses associated with such derivatives are recognized currently in other income and expense.  Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets   The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 28, 2002, the Company has made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets except those made in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional and annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2001, and August 30, 2002, respectively, and found no impairment. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.  SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 7 years.  Foreign Currency Translation   The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to ""accumulated translation adjustment"" included in ""accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)"" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange  55      rates, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations are included in the Company's results of operations.  Revenue Recognition   Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), consulting and implementation services, and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until product is received by the customer because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For other product sales, these criteria are met by the Company at the time product is shipped. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates and other sales programs and volume-based incentives.  Revenue for consulting and implementation services is recognized upon performance and acceptance by the customer. Revenue from extended warranty and support contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period. Amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognized on extended warranty and support contracts are recognized as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met.  Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element. Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is generally determined based on the price charged when each element is sold separately.  Shipping Costs   The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented.  Warranty Expense   The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized.  Research and Development   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed.  During the third and fourth quarter of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named ""Jaguar"") subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002 and prior to release of the final version of the product in the fourth quarter. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of  56      Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth quarter when Jaguar was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over 3 years. In addition, during 2002, the Company also began capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization, which began upon achievement of technological feasibility in the first quarter, amounted to approximately $6 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released in July.  During 2001 the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X, subsequent to release of a public beta version of the product and prior to release of the final product version. As a result, the Company capitalized approximately $5.4 million of development costs during 2001 associated with development of Mac OS X. Related amortization is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset of 8 years.  Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $1.2 million and $350,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Advertising Costs   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $209 million, $261 million, and $281 million for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation   The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and has provided pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.  Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan purchases subsequent to September 29, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair values for these options and stock purchases were estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares are amortized to pro forma net income over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares.  57     For purposes of the pro forma disclosures pursuant to SFAS No. 123 provided in the Company's annual reports through 2002, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company have been based solely on historical volatility rates of the Company's common stock. The Company has made no adjustments to its expected volatility assumptions based on current market conditions, current market trends, or expected volatility implicit in market traded options on the Company's stock. The Company will continue to monitor the propriety of this approach to developing its expected volatility assumption and could determine for future periods that adjustments to historical volatility and/or use of a methodology that is based on the expected volatility implicit in market traded options on the Company's common stock are more appropriate based on the facts and circumstances existing in future periods.  Earnings Per Common Share   Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is reflected using the if-converted method. Dilutive potential shares of common stock related to stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share for fiscal 2001 because their effect would have been antidilutive.  Stock Split   On June 21, 2000, the Company affected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a Common Stock dividend to shareholders of record as of May 19, 2000. All per share data and numbers of Common shares have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.  Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, from unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and from net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  Segment Information   The Company reports segment information based on the ""management"" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.  Note 2Financial Instruments   The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of those instruments.  58     Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments   The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's cash and available-for-sale securities held in its short-term investment portfolio, recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001 (in millions):         September 28, 2002   September 29, 2001   Cash   $ 161   $ 138   U.S. Treasury and Agency securities     47        U.S. corporate securities     1,952     1,998   Foreign securities     92     174               Total cash equivalents     2,091     2,172   U.S. Treasury and Agency securities     681     1,042   U.S. corporate securities     988     692   Foreign securities     416     292               Total short-term investments     2,085     2,026               Total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments   $ 4,337   $ 4,336              The Company's U.S. corporate securities include commercial paper, loan participations, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities include foreign commercial paper, loan participation, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Net unrealized gains on the Company's investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, were $20 million as of September 28, 2002 and $11 million as of September 29, 2001. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of $7 million in 2002 and $1 million in 2001. These net gains were included in interest and other income, net.  As of September 28, 2002, approximately $1.087 billion of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities of between 1 and 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 28, 2002 all had maturities of between 3 and 12 months. As of September 29, 2001, approximately $313 million of the Company's short-term investments in U.S. agency securities had underlying maturities of between 1 and 4 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 29, 2001, all had maturities of between 3 and 12 months.  Accounts Receivable   Trade Receivables   The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and directly to certain education and consumer customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables through the use of flooring arrangements for selected customers with third-party financing companies and credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America and Asia. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from a single customer, Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.8% and 9.4% of net accounts receivable as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively.  59     The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in millions).         2002   2001   2000     Beginning allowance balance   $ 51   $ 64   $ 68     Charged to costs and expenses     10     7     5     Deductions (a)     (10 )   (20 )   (9 )                  Ending allowance balance   $ 51   $ 51   $ 64                        (a)Represent amounts written off against the allowance, net of recoveries.    Non-Trade Receivables   The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balances sheets in other current assets, totaled $142 million and $68 million as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales.  Inventory Prepayment   In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components in the three consecutive fiscal quarters ending December 28, 2002. If the supplier fails to supply the agreed upon level of components in any of those three fiscal quarters, the Company may cancel the arrangement and receive the amount of the prepayment not utilized plus a penalty. Approximately $53 million of this deposit remained unused as of September 28, 2002, and is reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in other current assets. The amount of the prepayment not utilized by the Company on or before December 31, 2002, is refundable to the Company by January 31, 2003.  Although the supplier's existing debt is unrated, its public debt pricing is consistent with other BBB rated companies. The deposit is unsecured and has no stated interest component. The Company is imputing an amount to cost of sales and interest income during each period the deposit is outstanding at an appropriate market interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction. In light of the supplier's implied debt rating and because the Company's prepayment is unsecured, non-performance by and/or economic deterioration of the supplier could place all or some of the Company's deposit at risk.  Derivative Financial Instruments   The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenues and cost of sales. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  60       The following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate derivative and foreign currency instruments as of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001 (in millions).         September 28, 2002   September 29, 2001       Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Transactions qualifying as accounting hedges:                                         Interest rate instruments:                                           Swaps   $    $    $    $    $    $      Foreign exchange instruments:                                           Spot/Forward contracts, net   $ 462   $ 1   $ 1   $ 562   $ 8   $ 8       Purchased options, net   $ 196   $    $    $ 551   $ 11   $ 11       Sold options, net   $ 392   $ (4 ) $    $ 712   $ (8 ) $     Transactions other than accounting hedges:                                               Foreign exchange instruments:                                           Spot/Forward contracts, net   $ 302   $    $    $ 455   $ (4 ) $        Purchased options, net   $    $    $    $ 334   $ 1   $ 1       Sold options, net   $    $    $    $ 354   $ (1 ) $     The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange and interest rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of interest rates and currency exchange rates.  The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001. In certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate and foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the interest rate and foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.  Foreign Exchange Risk Management   The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  61     In accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For currency forward contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date.  For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction determined as the sum of the probability-weighted outcomes with respect to the option strike rates with the total change in fair value of the option hedge. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any residual changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense.  To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 9 months.  The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. Hedge effectiveness on forwards designated as net investment hedges is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense.  As discussed above, the Company enters into foreign currency option contracts as items that provide an offset to the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. All changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts based on changes in option time value are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.  Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a  62       subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. During 2002, the Company recorded net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. During 2001, the Company recorded a net gain of $5.1 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales.  Interest Rate Risk Management   The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management.  As of September 30, 2000, the Company had entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps. During fiscal 2001, the Company closed out all of its existing debt interest rate swap positions due to prevailing market interest rates realizing a gain of $17 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt.  The unrealized loss on the assets swaps as of September 30, 2000, of $5.7 million was deferred and then recognized in income in 2001 as part of the SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment effective on October 1, 2000. The Company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during 2001 realizing a gain of $1.1 million.  As of September 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. Due to perceived market risk, the Company entered into interest rate swaps in early 2002. These interest rate swaps were entered into with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt. The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair  63       value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps during fiscal 2002 until the Company closed out the positions in late 2002 due to prevailing market interest rates. Closing the debt interest rate swaps resulted in a realized gain of $6 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt.  Long-Term Debt   During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. As of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001, the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt interest rate swaps, was $316 million and $317 million, respectively, while the fair value was $299 million and $295 million, respectively. The fair value of the notes is based on their listed market values as of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001.  Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses   The Company has held significant investments in EarthLink Network, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments, and their combined fair value was $39 million and $128 million as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively.  EarthLink   In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment is in EarthLink's Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Mac customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold in the United States.  During the second quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary requiring that its cost basis be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down be included in earnings. As a result, the Company recognized a $114 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $86 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 425,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $6 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $800,000. As of September 29, 2001, the Company held 6.7 million shares of EarthLink stock with a fair value of approximately $102 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in  64       EarthLink to $35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company holds 6.5 million shares of EarthLink stock valued at $35 million.  Akamai   In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. Beginning in the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale. The fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai was approximately $216 million as of September 30, 2000. During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $36 million. As of September 29, 2001, the Company held 3.1 million shares of Akamai stock valued at $9 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to $3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company holds 2.9 million shares of Akamai stock valued at $3 million.  ARM Holdings   ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. As of September 28, 2002, the Company holds 278,000 shares of ARM stock valued at $578,000.  During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $176 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $174 million. As of September 29, 2001, the Company held 5 million shares of ARM stock valued at $17 million. During 2000, the Company sold a total of approximately 45.2 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $372 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $367 million.  Samsung   During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel display production capacity. The investment was in the form of three year unsecured bonds, which were convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock beginning in July 2000. The bonds carried an annual coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at their maturity. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung was approximately $123 million as of September 30, 2000.  Prior to its sale, the Company had categorized its investment in Samsung as available-for-sale requiring that it be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung was approximately $123 million as of September 30, 2000. With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on October 1, 2000, the Company was required to account for the conversion option embedded in the  65       Samsung bonds separately from the related debt. The conversion feature was carried at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. Included in the $17 million gross SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment recorded in earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 was a $23 million favorable adjustment for the restatement to fair value as of October 1, 2000, of the derivative component of the Company's investment in Samsung. To adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to fair value as of December 30, 2000, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million during the first quarter of 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company sold this investment for book value, including accrued interest, and received net proceeds of approximately $117 million.  Other Strategic Investments   The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in other assets. These investments are inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies are typically not fully developed. During 2001 the Company determined that the decline in fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of approximately $8 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. During 2002, the Company determined that the decline in fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of $15 million. These charges were included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company has no private debt or equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to  68      acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible assets acquired   $ 2.3   Acquired technology     3.8   Tradename     0.8   In-process research and development     0.5   Goodwill     18.6            Total consideration   $ 26.0           The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83% complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts include finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined by an independent third-party valuation using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%.  Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail   During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of $20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent consideration which will be allocated to compensation expense over the next 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that will be amortized over 10 years.  Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC   During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an additional component of the cost of the acquired assets, will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years.  Acquisition of Spruce Technologies, Inc.   In July 2001, the Company acquired Spruce Technologies, Inc. (Spruce), a privately-held company that develops and markets DVD authoring products, for $14.9 million in cash. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Spruce is not subject to amortization pursuant to the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142.  69      The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Spruce from the date of acquisition. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible liabilities assumed   $ (0.7 )   Identifiable intangible assets     5.9     Goodwill     9.7                Total consideration   $ 14.9               Acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc.   In May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool), a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools and districts that enables schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track their children's progress. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of PowerSchool from the date of acquisition.  The purchase price of approximately $66.1 million consisted of the issuance of approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $61.2 million, the issuance of stock options with a fair value of $4.5 million, and $300,000 of direct transaction costs. The fair value of the common stock options issued was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility of 67%, expected life of 4 years, dividend rate of 0%, and risk-free rate of 4.73%. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible assets acquired   $ 0.2   Deferred stock compensation     12.8   Identifiable intangible assets     2.6   In-process research and development     10.8   Goodwill     39.7            Total consideration   $ 66.1           The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web-based student information system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined by an independent third-party valuation using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. The acquired intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years, respectively. Deferred stock compensation associated with restricted stock and options is being amortized over the required future vesting period of three years.  70      In the fourth quarter of 2001, an adjustment was made to increase goodwill associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool by $5.9 million due to the identification of previously unidentified loss contingencies that were in existence prior to consummation of the acquisition.  Acquisition-Related Deferred Stock Compensation   The Company allocated $12.8 million of its purchase consideration for PowerSchool to acquisition-related deferred stock compensation within shareholders' equity. This amount represents the intrinsic value of stock options assumed that vest as future services are provided by employees and related to 445,000 common shares issued contingent on continued employment of certain PowerSchool employee stockholders.  Pro Forma Financial Information   The unaudited pro forma financial information below presents the condensed consolidated financial results of the Company assuming that PowerSchool and Spruce, acquired in 2001, had been acquired at the beginning of 2000 and includes the effect of amortization of goodwill and other acquired identifiable intangible assets from that date. The impact of the charge for IPR&D associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool has been excluded. This pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations that would have been achieved had the acquisitions taken place at the beginning of 2000. Pro forma information follows (in millions, except per share amounts):         2001   2000   Net sales   $ 5,370   $ 7,994   Net income (loss)   $ (44 ) $ 767   Basic earnings (loss) per common share   $ (0.13 ) $ 2.35   Diluted earnings (loss) per common share   $ (0.13 ) $ 2.11    Note 5Special Charges   Restructuring Actions   2002 Restructuring Actions   During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail operating segment.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in Corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million, 161 of which were eliminated by September 28, 2002. Eliminated positions were primarily in Corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. As of September 28, 2002, substantially all of the $6 million accrual had been utilized, except for insignificant severance and related costs associated with the 19 remaining positions.  71       During the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions will result in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide, 415 of which were eliminated by September 28, 2002, at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. Of the original $24 million restructuring charge made during the first quarter of 2002, approximately $23 million had been spent as of September 28, 2002 and approximately $250,000 was reversed during the second quarter of 2002 due to lower actual costs than originally estimated for certain lease commitments and severance benefits. The remaining $1 million accrual relates primarily to future payments on abandoned operating leases.  2000 Restructuring Actions   During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was comprised of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with consolidation of various domestic and international sales and marketing functions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $2.5 million had been spent before the end of 2000, and the remainder was spent in 2001. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets, substantially all was utilized before the end of 2000.  Executive Bonus   During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which was not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge is for the cost of the aircraft. The other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. In the fourth quarter of 2002, all significant work and payments associated with the aircraft were complete. Of the original $90 million accrual, $2.4 million remained unspent at the end of fiscal 2002 and was reversed.  Technology Acquisition   As discussed in Note 4, during both 2002 and 2001 in its acquisition of Emagic and PowerSchool, respectively, the Company acquired certain technology that was under development and had no alternative future use. This resulted in the recognition of purchased in-process research and development in the amount of $551,000 for Emagic and $10.8 million for PowerSchool, which was charged to operations upon acquisition.  72     Note 6Income Taxes   The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):         2002   2001   2000     Federal:                         Current   $ 8   $ (20 ) $ 9       Deferred     (28 )   (8 )   239                          (20 )   (28 )   248                    State:                         Current     2                 Deferred     7     (10 )   23                          9     (10 )   23                    Foreign:                         Current     29     21     37       Deferred     4     2     (2 )                        33     23     35                    Provision for income taxes   $ 22   $ (15 ) $ 306                     The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $284 million, $363 million and $1.019 billion in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As of September 28, 2002, approximately half of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries and is generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company's consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $755 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  73      As of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001, the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):         2002   2001     Deferred tax assets:                   Accounts receivable and inventory reserves   $ 23   $ 26       Accrued liabilities and other reserves     102     110       Basis of capital assets and investments     35     54       Tax losses and credits     209     319                   Total deferred tax assets     369     509     Less valuation allowance     30     33                 Net deferred tax assets     339     476                 Deferred tax liabilities:                   Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries     308     489       Available-for-sale securities     1     14       Other     26     18                   Total deferred tax liabilities     335     521                 Net deferred tax asset (liability)   $ 4   $ (45 )                As of September 28, 2002, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $72 million, which expire from 2009 through 2021. These carryforwards are comprised of remaining operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $94 million and which expire between 2003 and 2022. The remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 28, 2002, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.  74      A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2001, 2000, and 1999) to income (loss) before provision for income taxes, is as follows (in millions):         2002   2001   2000     Computed expected tax (benefit)   $ 30   $ (18 ) $ 382     State taxes, net of federal effect     7     (7 )   15     Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries               (82 )   Nondeductible executive compensation     (1 )        32     Purchase accounting and asset acquisitions     3     10          Change in valuation allowance     (16 )        (27 )   Research & development credit, net     (8 )   (5 )   (5 )   Nondeductible expenses     4     3          Other items     3     2     (9 )                  Provision for (benefit from) income taxes   $ 22   $ (15 ) $ 306                    Effective tax rate     25 %   30 %   28 %    The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed audits of the Company's federal income tax returns through 1997. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years through 1997 have been resolved. The IRS is currently auditing the Company's federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2000. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.  Note 7Shareholders' Equity   Stock Repurchase Plan   In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During 2000, the Company repurchased a total of 2.55 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $116 million. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The Company engaged in no transactions relating to the stock repurchase plan in fiscal 2002. Since inception of the repurchase plan, the Company has repurchased or committed to repurchase a total of 6.55 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $217 million.  Preferred Stock   In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) entered into a patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series A nonvoting convertible preferred stock (""preferred stock"") for $150 million. These shares were convertible by Microsoft after August 5, 2000, into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $8.25 per share. During 2000, 74,250 shares of preferred stock were converted to 9 million shares of the Company's common stock. During 2001, the remaining 75,750 preferred shares were converted into 9.2 million shares of the Company's common stock.  75     Comprehensive Income   The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, (in millions):         2002   2001   2000     Unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities   $ 13   $ 30   $ 297     Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative investments     (11 )   4          Cumulative translation adjustments     (51 )   (56 )   (53 )                  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   $ (49 ) $ (22 ) $ 244                     The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to available-for-sale securities, net of taxes (in millions):         2002   2001   2000     Change in fair value of available-for-sale securities   $ (49 ) $ (183 ) $ 427     Less: adjustment for net (gains) losses realized and included in net income     32     (84 )   (272 )                  Change in unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities   $ (17 ) $ (267 ) $ 155                     The tax effect related to the change in unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities was $10 million, $157 million, $(91) million for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The tax effect on the reclassification adjustment for net gains included in net income was $10 million, $35 million and $94 million for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.  The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives, net of taxes, held by the Company (in millions):         2002   2001     Cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133   $    $ 12     Changes in fair value of derivatives     4     45     Less: adjustment for net gains realized and included in net income     (19 )   (53 )               Change in unrealized gain on derivatives   $ (15 ) $ 4                  The tax effect related to the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 was $(5) as of September 29, 2001. The tax effect related to the changes in fair value of derivatives was $(2) million and $(19) million for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The tax effect related to derivative gains reclassified from OCI was $8 million and $23 million for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Note 8Employee Benefit Plans   1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan   The 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan (the 1998 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan which replaced the 1990 Stock Option Plan terminated in April 1998, the 1981 Stock Option Plan terminated in October 1990, and the 1987 Executive Long Term Stock Option Plan terminated in July 1995. Options granted before these plans' termination dates remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. Options may be granted under the 1998 Plan to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, executive officers of the Company at the  76      level of Senior Vice President and above, and other key employees. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The 1998 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.  1997 Employee Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant date.  1997 Director Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant. Prior to adoption of the DSOP, 60,000 options were granted in total to two then-current members of the Company's Board of Directors.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan   The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. During 2002, 2001, and 2000, 1.8 million, 1.8 million and 766,000 shares, respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 28, 2002, approximately 2.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.  Employee Savings Plan   The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($11,000 for calendar year 2002). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $19 million, $17 million, and $16 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.  77     Stock Option Activity   A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the years ended September 28, 2002, September 29, 2001 and September 30, 2000 follows (option amounts are presented in thousands):             Outstanding Options       Shares Available for Grant   Number of Shares   Weighted Average Exercise Price   Balance at 9/25/99   41,727   36,808   $ 13.20     Additional Options Authorized   13,500             Options Granted   (45,662 ) 45,662   $ 46.52     Options Cancelled   4,846   (4,846 ) $ 28.42     Options Exercised      (6,866 ) $ 9.62     Plan Shares Expired   (2,881 )                         Balance at 9/30/00   11,530   70,758   $ 34.01     Additional Options Authorized   27,000             Options Granted   (34,857 ) 34,857   $ 18.58     Options Cancelled   6,605   (6,605 ) $ 29.32     Options Exercised      (1,831 ) $ 10.05     Plan Shares Expired   (203 )                         Balance at 9/29/01   10,075   97,179   $ 29.24     Additional Options Authorized   15,000             Options Granted   (23,239 ) 23,239   $ 19.89     Options Cancelled   4,737   (4,737 ) $ 30.98     Options Exercised      (6,251 ) $ 11.99     Plan Shares Expired   (2 )                         Balance at 9/28/02   6,571   109,430   $ 28.17                    78       The options outstanding as of September 28, 2002, have been segregated into five ranges for additional disclosure as follows (option amounts are presented in thousands):         Options Outstanding   Options Exercisable       Options Outstanding as of September 28, 2002   Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life in Years   Weighted Average Exercise Price   Options Exercisable as of September 28, 2002   Weighted Average Exercise Price   $0.83-$17.31   22,000   6.63   $ 14.26   13,459   $ 12.74   $17.32-$18.50   26,785   8.32   $ 18.40   10,138   $ 18.38   $18.51-$25.93   20,851   8.86   $ 21.35   4,902   $ 21.14   $25.94-$43.59   21,492   7.27   $ 42.92   20,896   $ 43.16   $43.60-$69.78   18,302   7.37   $ 49.64   8,529   $ 49.71                             $0.83-$69.78   109,430   7.72   $ 28.17   57,924   $ 30.85                              The Company had exercisable options to purchase 42.1 million shares outstanding as of September 29, 2001 with a weighted average exercise price of $32.15. As of September 30, 2000, the Company had exercisable options outstanding to purchase 23.7 million shares with a weighted average exercise price of $31.94.  Note 9Stock-Based Compensation   Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan purchases subsequent to September 29, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair values for these options and stock purchases were estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used for each of the last three fiscal years and the resulting estimate of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those years are as follows:         2002   2001   2000     Expected life of stock options     4 years     4 years     4 years     Expected life of stock purchases     6 months     6 months     6 months     Interest ratestock options     2.90 %   4.90 %   6.20 %   Interest ratestock purchases     2.71 %   5.97 %   6.21 %   Volatilitystock options     64 %   66 %   67 %   Volatilitystock purchases     51 %   90 %   60 %   Dividend yields     0     0     0      Weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year   $  10.11   $  10.15   $  25.92     Weighted-average fair value of stock purchases during the year   $ 6.73   $ 11.15   $ 10.66      79     For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares are amortized to pro forma net income over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts):         2002   2001   2000   Net income (loss)as reported   $ 65   $ (25 ) $ 786    Net income (loss)pro forma   $  (164 ) $  (396 ) $  483    Net income (loss) per common shareas reported                          Basic   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 ) $ 2.42     Diluted   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 ) $ 2.18    Net income (loss) per common sharepro forma                          Basic   $ (0.46 ) $ (1.15 ) $ 1.49     Diluted   $ (0.46 ) $ (1.15 ) $ 1.38    Note 10Commitments and Contingencies   Lease Commitments   The Company leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The major facilities leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 12 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $92 million, $80 million, and $72 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 28, 2002, are as follows (in millions):     Fiscal Years        2003   $ 83   2004     78   2005     66   2006     55   2007     42   Later years     140          Total minimum lease payments   $ 464           Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product   Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits, or (""ASICs"")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing  80      vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the majority of which occurs in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules and levels, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations.  Contingencies   Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days.  The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  The parliament of the European Union is working on finalizing the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive). The Directive makes producers of electrical goods, including personal computers, financially responsible for the collection, recycling, and safe disposal of past and future products. The Directive must now be approved and implemented by individual European Union governments by June 2004, while the producers' financial obligations are scheduled to start June 2005. The Company's potential liability resulting from the Directive related to past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial. However, because it is likely that specific laws, regulations, and enforcement policies will vary significantly between individual European member states, it is not currently possible to estimate the Company's existing liability or future expenses resulting from the Directive. As the European Union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with respect to the Directive, the Company will continue to assess its potential financial impact. Similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies, including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.  81      Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data   The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar products and services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1, except as described below for the Retail segment.  The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes revenue from third-parties, cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress which is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $106 million in 2002 and $92 million in 2001.  Operating income for all segments except Retail includes cost of sales at standard cost. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses.  To assess the operating performance of the Retail segment several significant items are included in its results for internal management reporting that are not included in results of the Company's other segments. First, cost of sales for the Retail segment includes a mark-up above the Company's standard cost to approximate the price normally charged to the Company's major channel partners in the United States. For the twelve-month period ended September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $52 million and $4 million, respectively. Second, the Retail segment includes in its net sales proceeds from sales of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts. This treatment is consistent with how the Company's major channel partners account for the sale of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts. Because the revenue from these contracts has yet to be earned by the Company, an offset to this amount is reflected as a decrease in other segments' net sales. For the twelve-month period ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of additional net sales by the Retail segment, and an offsetting reduction to other segments' net sales of $4.8 million. This amount was insignificant in 2001. Third, a portion of the operating expenses associated with certain high profile retail stores are allocated from the Retail segment to corporate marketing expense. Allocation of these expenses reflects the unique nature of these stores which, given their larger size and extraordinary design elements, function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand  82       awareness. Allocated operating costs are those in excess of operating costs incurred by one of the Company's more typical retail locations. Stores were open in two such high profile locations in New York and Los Angeles as of September 28, 2002, both of which were opened in fiscal 2002. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these two stores was $1 million in 2002.

Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the United States, and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facilities in Cork, Ireland and Singapore or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals, currency exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. During 2000, a single distributor, Ingram Micro Inc. accounted for approximately 11.5% of the Company's net sales. Net sales during 2000 to Ingram Micro Inc. in the Americas and Europe segments were $651 million and $255 million, respectively. Net sales to Ingram Micro Inc. in all other segments were $14 million.

At September 29, 2001, the Company had options to purchase 97.2 million shares of its common stock outstanding, all of which were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for 2001 because the effect would have been antidilutive. Options to purchase 2.5 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 2000 that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for that year because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for that year and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.  Note 13Related Party Transactions   Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of the Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (""MicroWarehouse"") in January 2000. He also serves as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a multi-billion dollar specialty catalog and online retailer and direct marketer of computer products, including products made by the  86      Company, through its MacWarehouse catalog. MicroWarehouse accounted for 3.3% and 2.89% of the Company's net sales in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $20.9 million and $7.6 million as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively. These receivables are subject to the same credit risk as the Company's other trade receivables. In addition, the Company purchases miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases amounted to approximately $2.9 million in 2002 and $3.4 million in 2001.  In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. During 2002, the Company recognized a total of $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to this reimbursement agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2001 and 2002.  In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his principal residence. The loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due date of the loan, that he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan.

This amount was previously reported as a bonus for fiscal year 2000 in the Company's 2000 Form 10-K and 2000 Proxy Statement. Because the aircraft was transferred to Mr. Jobs in 2001, the amount of approximately $43.5 million paid by the Company during fiscal year 2001 towards the purchase of the plane and the related tax assistance of approximately $40.5 million was reported as income to Mr. Jobs. In fiscal 2002, approximately $2.27 million paid by the Company towards the purchase of the plane and approximately $1.3 million in related tax assistance was reported as income to Mr. Jobs. Accordingly, the $90 million previously reported as a bonus in 2000 has been removed from the table above, and the amounts reported as taxable income by Mr. Jobs related to the aircraft during each of fiscal 2001 and 2002 is reported as compensation. (2)Consists of matching contributions made by the Company in accordance with the terms of the 401(k) plan.

(2)All options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value based on the closing market value of Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the date of grant. (3)Potential gains are net of exercise price, but before taxes associated with exercise. These amounts represent certain assumed rates of appreciation only, based on SEC rules, and do not represent the Company's estimate or projection of the price of the Company's stock in the future. Actual gains, if any, on stock option exercises depend upon the actual future price of Common Stock and the continued employment of the option holders throughout the vesting period. Accordingly, the potential realizable values set forth in this table may not be achieved.  93        Options Exercised and Year-End Option Holdings   The following table provides information about stock option exercises by the Named Executive Officers during fiscal year 2002 and stock options held by each of them at fiscal year-end.

(3)Includes 60,000 options granted to Mr. Jobs in his capacity as a director pursuant to the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan.  Director Compensation   In 1997, the Company ended its practice of paying cash retainers and fees to directors, and approved the Apple Computer, Inc. 1997 Director Stock Option Plan (the  Director Plan). The Director Plan was approved by the shareholders in April 1998 and 800,000 shares have been reserved for issuance under the Director Plan. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Company's non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of Common Stock upon their initial election to the Board (Initial Options). On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee director's initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock (Annual Options). Initial Options vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant. Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. As of the end of the fiscal year, there were options for 360,000 shares outstanding under the Director Plan. Since accepting the position of CEO, Mr. Jobs is no longer eligible for grants under the Director Plan.  Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation   The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. William V. Campbell, Millard S. Drexler and Arthur B. Levinson, none of whom are employees of the Company and all of whom are considered ""independent"" directors under the applicable NASDAQ rules. During fiscal 2002, William V. Campbell, Arthur D. Levinson and Jerome B. York served as members of the Compensation Committee, none of whom were employees of the Company. No person who was an employee of the Company in fiscal year 2002 served on the Compensation Committee. During fiscal year 2002, Mr. Jobs served as a director of Gap Inc. (""Gap"") (though not on the compensation committee of that board of directors) and Mr. Drexler served as a director of the Company. Mr. Jobs resigned as a director of Gap in September 2002. Mr. Drexler resigned as president and CEO of Gap in September 2002 and resigned as a  94      director of Gap in October 2002. Subsequently, in November 2002, Mr. York resigned from the committee, and Mr. Drexler was appointed as a member of the Compensation Committee. No executive officer of the Company (i) served as a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee, (ii) served as a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee, or (iii) served as a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of the Company.

It does not include shares under the 1990 Stock Option Plan which was terminated in 1997. No new options can be granted under the 1990 Stock Option Plan. (2)Reflects shares authorized for future issuance under the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan.  1997 Employee Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant date.  Change In Control ArrangementsStock Options   In the event of a ""change in control"" of the Company, all outstanding options under the Company's stock option plans, except the Director Plan, will, unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator, become exercisable in full, and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable ""change in control price"" and the exercise price. The Director Plan provides that upon a  96      ""change in control"" of the Company, all unvested options held by non-employee directors will automatically become fully vested and exercisable and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable ""change in control price"" and the exercise price of the options. A ""change in control"" under these plans is generally defined as (i) the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities or (ii) the occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.  In addition, options granted to the Named Executive Officers generally provide that in the event there is a ""change in control"", as defined in the Company's stock option plans, and if in connection with or following such ""change in control"", their employment is terminated without ""Cause"" or if they should resign for ""Good Reason"", those options outstanding that are not yet vested and exercisable as of the date of such ""change in control"" shall become fully vested and exercisable. Generally, ""Cause"" is defined to include a felony conviction, willful disclosure of confidential information or willful and continued failure to perform his or her employment duties. ""Good Reason"" includes resignation of employment as a result of a substantial diminution in position or duties, or an adverse change in title or reduction in annual base salary.      Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions      In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Johnson (Senior Vice President, Retail) $1,500,000 for the purchase of his principal residence. The loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due date of the loan, that he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. The largest amount of the indebtedness outstanding on this loan during fiscal year 2002 was $1,500,000.  Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of the Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. He also serves as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a multi-billion dollar specialty catalog and online retailer and direct marketer of computer products, including products made by the Company, through its MacWarehouse catalogue. During fiscal year 2002, MicroWarehouse accounted for 3.3% of the Company's net sales. The Company also purchases products from MicroWarehouse for its own internal use.  In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. During 2002, the Company recognized a total of $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to this reimbursement agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2001 and 2002.      Item 14. Controls and Procedures      Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  97     There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. There were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and therefore there were no corrective actions taken. However, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there is no certainty that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goal under all potential future considerations, regardless of how remote.  98            PART IV          Item 15.

"Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading ""Markets and Distribution,"" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  46      The Company's business is subject to the risks of international operations.   A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the Company's results of operations.  Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  Derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions, and interest rate swap and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates.  Further information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading ""Foreign Currency Risk"" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  The Company's future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the Company's hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.   The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company's operating system, on a timely basis or at all.  In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Company's products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence  47      the decision of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database management, and high-quality presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application.  In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and results of operations. In June of 2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet Explorer for the Mac OS. Microsoft's decision to discontinue development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X appears to have been influenced in part by the Company's introduction during 2003 of its own web browser, Safari. It is unclear what impact, if any, Microsoft's decision to cease further development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X will have on the Company. However, if customers chose not to purchase the Company's products because Internet Explorer is not available on the Macintosh platform or should websites fail to provide support for web browsers other than Internet Explorer, the Company's net sales and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The Company's business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company's future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.   Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms.  Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company's future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in  48      Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.   The Company's profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part, on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that period's net sales.  The typical concentration of net sales in the third month of the Company's fiscal quarters can adversely affect the Company's business and operating results.   The Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company's ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition.  The Company's success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.   Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Company's employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the Company's future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel.  The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.   The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost.  Business interruptions could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.   The Company's major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical conditions, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. The Company's operating results and financial  49     condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster.  Failure of the Company's information technology systems and breaches in the security of data could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.   Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company's ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns by its implementation of sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.  The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen.   The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.  The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.   Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan and California. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial position.  Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.   Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including the FASB and the SEC, who interpret and create appropriate accounting regulations. A change from current accounting regulations can have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations and could impact the manner in which the Company conducts business.  Unanticipated changes in the Company's tax rates could affect its future results.   The Company's future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes  50     resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition.  The Company's stock price may be volatile.   The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive performance in the Company's stock price, as well as general economic and political conditions and investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company's stock in the future.  The Company's acquisition activity could disrupt its ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transaction.   The Company has acquired and may continue to acquire companies that have products, services, personnel and technologies that complement the Company's strategic direction and product roadmap. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in incorporating the acquired companies' operations and technologies; distraction of management's attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with acquisition; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company's due diligence process, including product quality issues and legal contingencies. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that the Company's previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect business, operating results or financial condition. The Company has generally paid cash for its acquisitions. Should the Company issue its common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders' percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted.  51         Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management   To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the non-hedge portfolios, the Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and option positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial position. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 as of October 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income.  Interest Rate Risk   While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  The Company's fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Company's investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process.  During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004.  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 and 5 years. As of September 28, 2002, $1.087 billion of the Company's investment portfolio classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. Due to liquidity needs, or in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for the purpose of duration management of the Company's investment portfolio, the Company may sell investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002.  52      In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 27, 2003, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $12.9 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 28, 2002, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $37.7 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Company's policy is to hold investments to maturity.  The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company entered into no interest rate asset swaps during 2003 or 2002 and had no open interest rate asset swaps at September 27, 2003.  In prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest rate debt swaps, which qualified as accounting hedges, generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of $6 million. During 2001 the Company closed out all of its then existing debt swap positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2002 and 2001 were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and are being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt.  Foreign Currency Risk   Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, generally benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries.  In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign  53      exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $7.5 million as of September 27, 2003 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $3.8 million as of September 28, 2002. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.  Actual gains and losses in the future associated with the Company's investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 27, 2003 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company's actual exposures and positions.  54             Item 8.

manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, peripherals and personal computing and communicating solutions. The Company's products include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the Mac OS X operating system, the iPod digital music player, and a portfolio of software products and peripherals for education, creative, consumer and business customers. The Company sells its products through its online stores, direct sales force, third-party wholesalers and resellers, and its own retail stores.  Basis of Presentation and Preparation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  Typically, the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar.  Financial Instruments   Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments   The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.  Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments   The Company has made investments in non-current debt and equity investments of public and privately held companies that have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long-term assets within other assets. They are not categorized as current assets either because, given their nature, they are not readily convertible into cash or because they represent potentially longer-term investments by the Company. Further, the fair value of these investments has been subject to a high degree of volatility. The Company's non-current debt and equity investments have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. However, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other-than-temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and expense. Occasionally, the Company uses short-term equity derivatives to  60     manage potential dispositions of non-current debt and equity investments. Any gains or losses associated with such derivatives are recognized currently in other income and expense.  Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity   On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150,  Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment related to a forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003, which resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million representing the increase in fair value of the agreement from June 29, 2003 through the settlement date.  Derivative Financial Instruments   On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to other comprehensive income of approximately $12 million, all of which was reclassified to earnings during 2001. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income.  For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current  61      earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current period.  For foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. For interest rate swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133.  Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.  Property, Plant, and Equipment   Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years.  Asset Retirement Obligations   On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. All of the Company's existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company estimated that as of September 29, 2002, gross expected future cash flows of $9.5 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.  62     As of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $6 million long-term asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold improvements. This amount represents the present value of expected future cash flows associated with returning certain of the Company's leased properties to original condition. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow of $9.5 million and its present value of $6 million at September 29, 2002, is being accreted over the life of the related leases as an operating expense. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during the first quarter of 2003 of approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.  The following table reconciles changes in the Company's asset retirement liability for fiscal 2003 (in millions):     Asset retirement liability recorded at September 29, 2002   $ 5.5     Additional asset retirement obligations recognized     0.5     Accretion recognized     1.2          Asset retirement liability as of September 27, 2003   $ 7.2           Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets   The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 27, 2003, the Company has made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets, except those made in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2001, and its annual goodwill impairment tests at August 30, 2003 and August 30, 2002, respectively, and found no impairment. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.  SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.  Foreign Currency Translation   The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and  63     expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in ""accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)"" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations.  Revenue Recognition   Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed and determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable.  Revenue from extended warranty and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty and support periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, certain repairs, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the Company's one-year basic limited parts and labor warranty.  The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies at the gross amount billed.  Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of each element. Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. VSOE is determined based on the price charged when each element is sold separately.  The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience.  64      Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. However, a limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.  Shipping Costs   The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented.  Warranty Expense   The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.  Research and Development   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named ""Panther""), which enhances the features and functionality of the previous version of Mac OS X, subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million of development costs associated with the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset began in the first quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named ""Jaguar"") subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the fourth quarter of 2002. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth quarter of 2002 when Jaguar was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. In addition, during 2002, the Company also began capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization of approximately $6 million began upon achievement of technological feasibility in the first quarter of 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released in July 2002.  During 2001 the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X, subsequent to release of a public beta version of the product and prior to release of the final product version. As a result, the Company capitalized approximately $5.4 million of development costs during 2001 associated with development of Mac OS X. Related amortization is  65      computed by use of the straight-line method in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 8 year estimated useful life.  Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $5.8 million, $1.2 million and $350,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Advertising Costs   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $193 million, $209 million, and $261 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  Restructuring Charges   In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring) and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. This Statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 were required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities.  Stock-Based Compensation   The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-based CompensationTransition and Disclosure as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.  As required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in  66     management's opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares.  For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts):         2003   2002   2001     Net income (loss)as reported   $ 69   $ 65   $ (25 )    Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income (loss), net of tax      15      5      2     Deduct: Stock-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards, net of tax     (181 )   (234 )   (373 )                   Net losspro forma   $  (97 ) $  (164 ) $  (396 )                   Net income (loss) per common shareas reported                            Basic   $ 0.19   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 )     Diluted   $ 0.19   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 )    Net loss per common sharepro forma                            Basic   $ (0.27 ) $ (0.46 ) $ (1.15 )     Diluted   $ (0.27 ) $ (0.46 ) $ (1.15 )    Earnings Per Common Share   Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential shares of common stock related to stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share for fiscal 2001 because their effect would have been antidilutive.  67     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:     For the Years Ended    September 27, 2003   September 28, 2002   September 29, 2001     Numerator (in millions):                         Income (loss) before accounting changes   $ 68   $ 65   $ (37 )     Cumulative effects of accounting changes, net of income taxes   $ 1   $    $ 12                      Net income (loss)   $ 69   $ 65   $ (25 )                   Denominator (in thousands):                            Weighted-average shares outstanding     360,631     355,022     345,613       Effect of dilutive options and dilutive restricted stock     2,835     6,763                           Denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share     363,466     361,785     345,613                     Basic earnings (loss) per share before accounting changes   $  0.19   $  0.18   $  (0.11 )   Cumulative effects of accounting changes, net of tax             $ 0.04                    Basic earnings (loss) per share after accounting changes   $ 0.19   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 )                   Diluted earnings (loss) per share before accounting changes   $  0.19   $  0.18   $  (0.11 )   Cumulative effects of accounting changes, net of tax             $ 0.04                    Diluted earnings (loss) per share after accounting changes   $ 0.19   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 )                   Options to purchase 50.8 million and 58.0 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 2003 and 2002, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for that year because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for that year and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. At September 29, 2001, the Company had options to purchase 97.2 million shares of its common stock outstanding, all of which were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for 2001 because the effect would have been antidilutive.  Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  Segment Information   The Company reports segment information based on the ""management"" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.  68       Note 2Financial Instruments   The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of those instruments.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments   The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's cash and available-for-sale securities held in its short-term investment portfolio, recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002 (in millions):         September 27, 2003   September 28, 2002   Cash   $ 158   $ 161              U.S. Treasury and Agency securities      87      47   U.S. corporate securities     2,368     1,828   Foreign securities     783     216               Total cash equivalents     3,238     2,091              U.S. Treasury and Agency securities      454      674   U.S. corporate securities     623     1,330   Foreign securities     93     81               Total short-term investments     1,170     2,085               Total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments   $ 4,566   $ 4,337              The Company's short-term investment portfolio consists of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. The Company's U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses totaling $1 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year as of September 27, 2003 and net unrealized gains of $20 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, as of September 28, 2002. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. These net gains were included in interest and other income, net.  As of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 27, 2003 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 28, 2002, approximately $1.087 billion of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 28, 2002 had maturities of 3 to 12 months.  Accounts Receivable   Trade Receivables   The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia and by arranging with third-  69     party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from a single customer, Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.3% and 10.8% of net accounts receivable as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively.  The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Beginning allowance balance   $ 51   $ 51   $ 64     Charged to costs and expenses     4     10     7     Deductions (a)     (6 )   (10 )   (20 )                  Ending allowance balance   $ 49   $ 51   $ 51                        (a)Represents amounts written off against the allowance, net of recoveries.   Non-Trade Receivables   The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $184 million and $142 million as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales.  Inventory Prepayment   In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components during the three consecutive fiscal quarters ended December 28, 2002. Approximately $53 million of this deposit remained unused as of September 28, 2002 and was reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets. During the first six months of 2003, the remainder of the deposit balance was fully utilized for the purchase of components. The deposit was unsecured and had no stated interest component. The Company imputed an amount to cost of sales and interest income during each period the deposit was outstanding at a 3.25% interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction.  Derivative Financial Instruments   The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenues and cost of sales. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's  70     accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign currency instruments as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002 (in millions):         September 27, 2003   September 28, 2002       Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Foreign exchange instruments qualifying as accounting hedges:                                         Spot/Forward contracts   $ 464   $ (21 ) $    $ 462   $ 1   $ 1     Purchased options   $ 512   $ 3   $ 3   $ 196   $    $      Sold options   $ 645   $ (8 ) $    $ 392   $ (4 ) $     Foreign exchange instruments other than accounting hedges:                                               Spot/Forward contracts   $ 445   $ 3   $ 3   $ 302   $    $      Purchased options   $ 8   $    $    $    $    $      Sold options   $ 5   $    $    $    $    $     The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates.  The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002. In certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.  Foreign Exchange Risk Management   The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  71     In accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For currency forward contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date.  For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense.  To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 9 months.  The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. Hedge effectiveness on forwards designated as net investment hedges is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense.  As discussed above, the Company enters into foreign currency option contracts as items that provide an offset to the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. All changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts based on changes in option time value are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.  Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with  72      such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. During 2002, the Company recorded net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. During 2001, the Company recorded a net gain of $5.1 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003.  Interest Rate Risk Management   The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.  As of September 30, 2000, the Company had entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps. During fiscal 2001, the Company closed out all of its existing debt interest rate swap positions due to prevailing market interest rates realizing a gain of $17 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt.  The unrealized loss on the asset swaps as of September 30, 2000, of $5.7 million was deferred and then recognized in income in 2001 as part of the SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment effective on October 1, 2000. The Company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during 2001 realizing a gain of $1.1 million.  As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. Due to perceived market risk, the Company entered into interest rate swaps in early 2002. The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps during fiscal 2002 until the Company closed out the positions in late 2002 due to prevailing market interest rates. Closing the debt interest rate swaps resulted in a realized gain  73      of $6 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt.  Debt   The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $4 million of related unamortized deferred gains on closed interest rate swaps, are due in February of 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of September 27, 2003. As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt interest rate swaps, was $304 million and $316 million, respectively, while the fair value was $302 million and $299 million, respectively. The fair value of the notes is based on their listed market values as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002.  Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses   The Company has held investments in EarthLink, Inc. (EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in total other income and expense. The combined fair value of these investments held by the Company was $5 million and $39 million as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, respectively.  EarthLink   In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment was in EarthLink's Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, which was convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Mac customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold in the United States.  During the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Company's carrying value of the shares. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in EarthLink, consisting of 3,960,000 shares of stock for net proceeds of approximately $23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 6.5 million shares of EarthLink stock valued at $35 million.  74      During the second quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary requiring that its cost basis be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down be included in earnings. As a result, the Company recognized a $114 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $86 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 425,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $6 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $800,000, and recognized related income tax of approximately $200,000.  Akamai   In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. Beginning in the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale.  During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $9 million and a gain before taxes of $8 million. As of September 27, 2003, the Company's remaining investment in Akamai consists of 986,000 shares of Akamai stock valued at $5 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to $3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 2.9 million shares of Akamai stock valued at $3 million.  During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $36 million.  ARM   ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology.  During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in ARM stock, consisting of 278,000 shares for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of $270,000.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 278,000 shares of ARM stock valued at $578,000.  During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $176 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $174 million, and recognized related income tax expense of approximately $52 million.  75        Samsung   During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel display production capacity. The investment was in the form of three year unsecured bonds, which were convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock beginning in July 2000. The bonds carried an annual coupon rate of 2% and paid a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at maturity.  Prior to its sale, the Company had categorized its investment in Samsung as available-for-sale requiring that it be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung was approximately $123 million as of September 30, 2000. With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on October 1, 2000, the Company was required to account for the conversion option embedded in the Samsung bonds separately from the related debt. The conversion feature was carried at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. Included in the $17 million gross SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment recorded in earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 was a $23 million favorable adjustment for the restatement to fair value as of October 1, 2000, of the derivative component of the Company's investment in Samsung. To adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to fair value as of December 30, 2000, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million during the first quarter of 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company sold this investment for book value, including accrued interest, and received net proceeds of approximately $117 million.  Other Strategic Investments   The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies, which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in other assets. These investments were inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies were typically not fully developed. During 2002 and 2001, the Company determined that the decline in fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of $15 million and $8 million, respectively. These charges were included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the Company had no private debt or equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheets.

The Company ceased amortization of goodwill at the beginning of fiscal 2002 when it adopted SFAS No. 142.  The following table summarizes the components of gross and net intangible asset balances (in millions):         September 27, 2003   September 28, 2002       Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Amount   Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Amount   Goodwill (a)   $ 85        $ 85   $ 85        $ 85   Other acquired intangible assets     5     (5 )        5     (5 )      Acquired technology     42     (18 )   24     42     (8 )   34                         Total acquired intangible assets   $ 132   $ (23 ) $ 109   $ 132   $ (13 ) $ 119                            (a)Accumulated amortization related to goodwill of $55 million arising prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 has been reflected in the gross carrying amount of goodwill as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002.

During fiscal 2003, contingent consideration totaling $1.3 million was paid. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Emagic is not subject to amortization pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible assets acquired   $ 2.3   Acquired technology     3.8   Tradename     0.8   In-process research and development     0.5   Goodwill     18.6            Total consideration   $ 26.0           79     The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83% complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003, included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%.  Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail   During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of $20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent consideration which will be allocated to compensation expense over the next 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that will be amortized over 10 years.  Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC   During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an additional component of the cost of the acquired assets, will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years.  Acquisition of Spruce Technologies, Inc.   In July 2001, the Company acquired Spruce Technologies, Inc. (Spruce), a privately-held company that develops and markets DVD authoring products, for $14.9 million in cash. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Spruce is not subject to amortization pursuant to the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Spruce from the date of acquisition. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible liabilities assumed   $ (0.7 )   Identifiable intangible assets     5.9     Goodwill     9.7                Total consideration   $ 14.9               Acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc.   In May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool), a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools and districts that enable schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track  80     their children's progress. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of PowerSchool from the date of acquisition.  The purchase price of approximately $66.1 million consisted of the issuance of approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $61.2 million, the issuance of stock options with a fair value of $4.5 million, and $300,000 of direct transaction costs. The fair value of the common stock options issued was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility of 67%, expected life of 4 years, dividend rate of 0%, and risk-free rate of 4.73%.  Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible assets acquired   $ 0.2   Deferred stock compensation     12.8   Identifiable intangible assets     2.6   In-process research and development     10.8   Goodwill     39.7            Total consideration   $ 66.1           The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web-based student information system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. The acquired intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Deferred stock compensation associated with restricted stock and options is being amortized over the required future vesting period of 3 years.  In the fourth quarter of 2001, an adjustment was made to increase goodwill associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool by $5.9 million due to the identification of previously unidentified loss contingencies that were in existence prior to consummation of the acquisition.  The Company allocated $12.8 million of its purchase consideration for PowerSchool to deferred stock compensation within shareholders' equity. This amount represented the intrinsic value of stock options assumed that vest as future services are provided by employees and related to 445,000 common shares issued contingent on continued employment of certain PowerSchool employee stockholders. Certain PowerSchool employee stockholders were terminated in the first quarter of 2003 resulting in the $5 million recognition of previously deferred stock compensation as part of the Company's first quarter restructuring action. Unamortized PowerSchool related deferred stock compensation of approximately $294,000 remains as of September 27, 2003.  Pro Forma Financial Information   The unaudited pro forma financial information below presents the condensed consolidated financial results of the Company assuming that PowerSchool and Spruce, acquired in 2001, had been acquired at the  81     beginning of 2001 and includes the effect of amortization of goodwill and other acquired identifiable intangible assets from that date. The impact of the charge for IPR&D associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool has been excluded. This pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations that would have been achieved had the acquisitions taken place at the beginning of 2001. Pro forma information follows (in millions, except per share amounts):         2001     Net sales   $ 5,370     Net loss   $ (44 )   Basic loss per common share   $ (0.13 )   Diluted loss per common share   $ (0.13 )    Note 5Restructuring Charges   Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions   The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $26.8 million, nearly all had been spent by the end of 2003, except for approximately $400,000 of severance costs and approximately $4.5 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and an approximately $500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense.  During the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including $2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees, 92 were terminated prior to the end of 2003.  During the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide, all but one of which were eliminated by the end of 2003.  Closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the  82      Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and marketing activities and employees, principally in the United States and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities of $6.7 million. The total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.  Except for certain costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities, the Company currently anticipates that all of the remaining accrual for severance costs of approximately $400,000 will be spent by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004.  The following table summarizes activity associated with restructuring actions initiated during fiscal 2003 (in millions):         Employee Severance Benefits   Deferred Compensation Write-off   Asset Impairments   Lease Cancellations   Totals     Total charge   $ 7.4   $ 5.0   $ 7.1   $ 7.3   $ 26.8     Total spending through September 27, 2003     (7.5 )             (2.3 )   (9.8 )   Total non-cash items          (5.0 )   (7.1 )        (12.1 )   Adjustments     0.5               (0.5 )                             Accrual at September 27, 2003   $ 0.4   $    $    $ 4.5   $ 4.9                           Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions   During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail operating segment.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled  83      $4 million. The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000.  The following table summarizes activity associated with restructuring actions initiated during fiscal 2002 (in millions):         Employee Severance Benefits   Asset Impairments   Lease and Contract Cancellations   Totals     Total charge   $ 10   $ 8   $ 12   $ 30     Total spending through September 27, 2003     (10 )        (11 )   (21 )   Total non-cash items          (8 )        (8 )   Adjustments               (1 )   (1 )                     Accrual at September 27, 2003   $    $    $    $                         Note 6Income Taxes   The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Federal:                         Current   $ 18   $ 12   $ (20 )     Deferred     (7 )   (32 )   (8 )                        11     (20 )   (28 )                  State:                         Current     4     3            Deferred     (11 )   6     (10 )                        (7 )   9     (10 )                  Foreign:                         Current     21     29     21       Deferred     (1 )   4     2                          20     33     23                    Provision for income taxes   $ 24   $ 22   $ (15 )                   84       The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $250 million, $284 million and $363 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. As of September 27, 2003, approximately $2.5 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company's consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $822 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):         2003   2002   Deferred tax assets:                 Accounts receivable and inventory reserves   $ 35   $ 32     Accrued liabilities and other reserves     155     126     Basis of capital assets and investments     47     34     Tax losses and credits     204     125     Other     11     11               Total deferred tax assets     452     328   Less valuation allowance     30     30             Net deferred tax assets     422     298             Deferred tax liabilities:                 Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries     398     293     Available-for-sale securities          1               Total deferred tax liabilities     398     294             Net deferred tax asset   $ 24   $ 4              As of September 27, 2003, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $189 million, which expire from 2011 through 2023. A portion of these carryforwards was acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $117 million and which expire between 2004 and 2023. The remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 27, 2003, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax  85      planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.  A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2003, 2002, and 2001) to income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, is as follows (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Computed expected tax (benefit)   $ 32   $ 30   $ (18 )   State taxes, net of federal effect     (4 )   7     (7 )   Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries     (13 )             Nondeductible executive compensation     5     (1 )        Stock repurchase     (2 )             Purchase accounting and asset acquisitions     4     3     10     Change in valuation allowance          (16 )        Research & development credit, net     (7 )   (8 )   (5 )   Nondeductible expenses     6     4     3     Other items     3     3     2                    Provision for (benefit from) income taxes   $ 24   $ 22   $ (15 )                  Effective tax rate     26 %   25 %   30 %    On April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2000 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 1998 have been resolved. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.  Note 7Shareholders' Equity   CEO Restricted Stock Award   On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Steven P. Jobs, its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Agreement cancelled stock option awards for the purchase of 27.5 million shares of the Company's common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 60,000 shares of the Company's common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Company's CEO. The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the Company's common stock. The restricted stock award generally vests three years from date of grant. Vesting of some or all of the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in control of the Company.  The Company has recorded the value of the restricted stock award of $74.75 million as a component of shareholders' equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over the 3-year service/vesting period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market price of the Company's  86      common stock on the date of the award. Total amortization of approximately $13 million has been included in selling, general, and administrative expense in 2003 and will continue to be included at approximately $6.2 million per quarter through March 2006. The 5 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.  Stock Repurchase Plan   In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.  During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81. Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 27, 2003.  Preferred Stock   In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series A nonvoting convertible preferred stock (""preferred stock"") for $150 million. These shares were convertible by Microsoft after August 5, 2000, into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $8.25 per share. During 2000, 74,250 shares of preferred stock were converted to 9 million shares of the Company's common stock. During 2001, the remaining 75,750 preferred shares were converted into 9.2 million shares of the Company's common stock.  Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities   $ 1   $ 13   $ 30     Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative investments     (16 )   (11 )   4     Cumulative foreign currency translation     (20 )   (51 )   (56 )                  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   $ (35 ) $ (49 ) $ (22 )                   87     The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to available-for-sale securities, net of taxes (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Change in fair value of available-for-sale securities   $ 11   $ (49 ) $ (183 )   Adjustment for net (gains) losses realized and included in net income (loss)     (23 )   32     (84 )                  Change in unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities   $ (12 ) $ (17 ) $ (267 )                   The tax effect related to the change in unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities was $6 million, $10 million, $157 million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The tax effect on the reclassification adjustment for net gains (losses) included in net income (loss) was $(8) million, $10 million and $35 million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives, net of taxes, held by the Company (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Changes in fair value of derivatives   $ (24 ) $ 4   $ 45     Adjustment for net gains realized and included in net income (loss)     19     (19 )   (53 )   Cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133               12                    Change in unrealized gain on derivative instruments   $ (5 ) $ (15 ) $ 4                     The tax effect related to the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 was $(5) as of September 29, 2001. The tax effect related to the changes in fair value of derivatives was $11 million, $(2) million and $(19) million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The tax effect related to derivative gains (losses) reclassified from other comprehensive income was $(7) million, $8 million and $23 million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  Note 8Employee Benefit Plans   2003 Employee Stock Option Plan   At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive officers and other key employees and to prohibit future ""repricings"" of employee stock options, including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.  1997 Employee Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997  88     Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares, following the completion of an employee stock option exchange program in October 2003.  Employee Stock Option Exchange Program   On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company's common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which would be at least six months plus one day after the exchange options are cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company accepted and cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193 shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Company's stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this transaction.  1997 Director Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant.  Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans   Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook and Mr. Fred D. Anderson, have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of Apple stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan   The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company's shareholders also approved an amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 4 million shares. Beginning with the six-month offering period that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, 2.1 million, 1.8 million and 1.8 million shares, respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 27, 2003, approximately 4.0 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.  89     Employee Savings Plan   The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($12,000 for calendar year 2003). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $21 million, $19 million, and $17 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

As of September 29, 2001, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 42.1 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $32.15.  Note 9Stock-Based Compensation   The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Exchange Program have been accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees. The cancellation of certain of the Company's Chief Executive Officer's options and replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.  91      The assumptions used for each of the last three fiscal years and the resulting estimate of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those years are as follows:         2003   2002   2001     Expected life of stock options     3.5-4 years     4 years     4 years     Expected life of stock purchases     6 months     6 months     6 months     Interest ratestock options     2.14%-2.45 %   2.90 %   4.90 %   Interest ratestock purchases     1.10%-1.77 %   2.71 %   5.97 %   Volatilitystock options     40%-63 %   64 %   66 %   Volatilitystock purchases     35%-44 %   51 %   90 %   Dividend yields     0     0     0      Weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year   $  6.63   $  10.11   $  10.15     Weighted-average fair value of stock purchases during the year   $ 4.24   $ 6.73   $ 11.15      For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company prior to the third quarter of 2003 have been based solely on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, the Company has modified this approach to consider other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock and the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company will continue to monitor these and other relevant factors in developing the expected volatility assumption used to value future awards.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, the Company shortened its estimate of the expected life of new options granted to its employees from 4 years to 3.5 years. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees. The change in the expected life assumption made during the third quarter of 2003 was the result of the expected impact of shortening the contractual life of new options granted to employees from 10 years to 7 years and changing the vesting provisions of new options granted to employees from 4 year straight-line annual vesting to 4 year straight-line quarterly vesting.  Note 10Commitments and Contingencies   Lease Commitments   The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 15 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 27, 2003, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $600 million, of which $354 million related to leases for retail space.  Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $97 million, $92 million, and $80 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Future minimum lease  92      payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 27, 2003, are as follows (in millions):     Fiscal Years        2004   $ 100   2005     100   2006     83   2007     64   2008     51   Later years     202          Total minimum lease payments   $ 600           Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications   The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future expectations.  The following table reconciles changes in the Company's accrued warranties and related costs (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Beginning accrued warranty and related costs   $ 69   $ 87   $ 108     Cost of warranty claims     (71 )   (79 )   (92 )   Accruals for product warranties     69     61     71                    Ending accrued warranty and related costs   $ 67   $ 69   $ 87                     The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 27, 2003 or September 28, 2002.  93        Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product   Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits, or (""ASICs"")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the majority of which occurs in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations.  Contingencies   Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard the Company's motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiff's claims with prejudice on August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling.  The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers  94      the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions that the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and California. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse affects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.  Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data   The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan. As of September 27, 2003, the Retail segment currently operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1, except as described below for the Retail segment.  The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segment's performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $92 million, $106 million, and $92 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  Operating income for all segments except Retail includes cost of sales at standard cost. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses.  To assess the operating performance of the Retail segment several significant items are included in its results for internal management reporting that are not included in results of the Company's other segments. First, cost of sales for the Retail segment includes a mark-up above the Company's standard cost to approximate the price normally charged to the Company's major channel partners in the United States. For the years ended September 27, 2003, September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001 this resulted in the  95      recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $106 million, $52 million, and $4 million, respectively.  Second, the Retail segment includes in its net sales proceeds from sales of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts and also recognizes related cost of sales based on the amount at which such contracts are normally sold to the Company's resellers operating retail stores in the United States. This treatment is consistent with how the Company's major resellers account for the sales and cost of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in the Americas segment's net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $30 million and $20 million, respectively. For the year ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $8 million and $6 million, respectively. These amounts were insignificant in fiscal 2001.  Third, a portion of the operating expenses associated with certain high profile retail stores are allocated from the Retail segment to corporate marketing expense. Allocation of these expenses reflects the unique nature of these stores which, given their larger size and extraordinary design elements, function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate sales and marketing events, and brand awareness. Allocated operating costs are those in excess of operating costs incurred by one of the Company's more typical retail locations. Stores were open in three such high profile locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago as of September 27, 2003. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these three stores were $6 million and $1 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.  96      Summary information by operating segment follows (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Americas:                         Net sales   $ 3,181   $ 3,131   $ 3,037       Operating income   $ 323   $ 278   $ 128       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 5   $ 4   $ 4       Segment assets(a)   $ 494   $ 395   $ 334      Europe:                            Net sales   $ 1,309   $ 1,251   $ 1,249       Operating income   $ 130   $ 122   $ 68       Depreciation and amortization   $ 4   $ 4   $ 6       Segment assets   $ 252   $ 165   $ 137      Japan:                            Net sales   $ 698   $ 710   $ 713       Operating income   $ 121   $ 140   $ 98       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 3   $ 2   $ 2       Segment assets   $ 130   $ 50   $ 44      Retail:                            Net sales   $ 621   $ 283   $ 19       Operating loss   $ (5 ) $ (22 ) $ (21 )     Depreciation, amortization and accretion(b)   $ 25   $ 16   $ 2       Segment assets(b)   $ 243   $ 141   $ 46      Other Segments(c):                            Net sales   $ 398   $ 367   $ 345       Operating income   $ 51   $ 44   $ 24       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 2   $ 2   $ 2       Segment assets   $ 78   $ 67   $ 70         (a)The Americas asset figures do not include fixed assets held in the United States. Such fixed assets are not allocated specifically to the Americas segment and are included in the corporate assets figures below. (b)Retail segment depreciation and asset figures reflect the cost and related depreciation of its retail stores and related infrastructure. Retail store construction-in-progress, which is not subject to depreciation, is reflected in corporate assets. (c)Other Segments consists of Asia-Pacific and FileMaker. Certain amounts in prior fiscal periods related to recent acquisitions and Internet services have been reclassified from Other Segments to the Americas segment to conform to the 2003 presentation.   97         A reconciliation of the Company's segment operating income and assets to the consolidated financial statements follows (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Segment operating income   $ 620   $ 562   $ 297     Corporate expenses, net     (595 )   (514 )   (630 )   Purchased in-process research and development          (1 )   (11 )   Restructuring costs     (26 )   (30 )                         Consolidated operating income (loss)   $ (1 ) $ 17   $ (344 )                   Segment assets   $  1,197   $  818   $  631     Corporate assets   $ 5,618   $ 5,480   $ 5,390                      Consolidated assets   $ 6,815   $ 6,298   $ 6,021                     Segment depreciation, amortization and accretion   $  39   $  28   $  16     Corporate depreciation, amortization and accretion     74     86     84                      Consolidated depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 113   $ 114   $ 100                     A large portion of the Company's net sales is derived from its international operations. Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the United States, and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals, currency exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2003, 2002 or 2001.

Note 12Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions   During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which was not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge was for the cost of the aircraft. The other half represented all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. In the fourth quarter of 2002, all significant work and payments associated with the aircraft were completed. Of the original $90 million accrual, $2.4 million remained unspent at the end of fiscal 2002 and was reversed.  In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $404,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during fiscal 2003. For fiscal 2002, the Company recognized a total of $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2001 and 2002. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included by the Company in selling, general, and administrative expenses.  In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his principal residence. The loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise  99      of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid $750,000 of this loan in fiscal 2003. The remaining $750,000 is due and payable in May 2004.  Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. Until September 7, 2003, he also served as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a reseller of computer hardware, software and peripheral products, including products made by the Company. On September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW), acquired selected North American assets of MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. MicroWarehouse accounted for 2.4%, 3.3%, and 2.9% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $9.9 million and $20.9 million as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively. The Company has provided what it believes to be an adequate allowance on the outstanding receivable based on the Company's secured interest position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected payments to unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables were generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those with the Company's other resellers. In addition, the Company purchases miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases amounted to approximately $2.3 million, $2.9 million, and $3.4 million in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in 2003, changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002, and changed its method of accounting for hedging activities in 2001.         /s/  KPMG LLP          Mountain View, California October 14, 2003  102            Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure      Not applicable.      Item 9A. Controls and Procedures      Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) were effective as of September 27, 2003 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  There were no significant changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  103         PART III          Item 10.

Mr. York is also a director of Tyco International Ltd. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.  104      Role of the Board; Corporate Governance Matters   It is the paramount duty of the Board of Directors to oversee the Chief Executive Officer and other senior management in the competent and ethical operation of the Company on a day-to-day basis and to assure that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being served. To satisfy this duty, the directors take a proactive, focused approach to their position, and set standards to ensure that the Company is committed to business success through maintenance of the highest standards of responsibility and ethics.  Members of the Board bring to the Company a wide range of experience, knowledge and judgment. These varied skills mean that good governance depends on far more than a ""check the box"" approach to standards or procedures. The governance structure in the Company is designed to be a working structure for principled actions, effective decision-making and appropriate monitoring of both compliance and performance. The key practices and procedures of the Board are outlined in the Corporate Governance Guidelines available on the Company's website at www.apple.com/investor.  Board Committees   The Board has a standing Compensation Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (""Nominating Committee"") and an Audit and Finance Committee (""Audit Committee"").  The Compensation Committee is primarily responsible for reviewing the compensation arrangements for the Company's executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, and for administering the Company's stock option plans. Members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Campbell, Drexler, Gore and Dr. Levinson.  The Nominating Committee assists the Board in identifying qualified individuals to become directors, determines the composition of the Board and its committees, monitors the process to assess Board effectiveness and helps develop and implement the Company's corporate governance guidelines. Members of the Nominating Committee are Messrs. Campbell, Drexler, Gore and Dr. Levinson.  The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing the services performed by the Company's independent auditors and internal audit department, evaluating the Company's accounting policies and its system of internal controls and reviewing significant financial transactions. Consistent with the Nasdaq audit committee structure and membership requirements, the Audit Committee is comprised of three members: Messrs. Campbell, York and Dr. Levinson. Because of Mr. York's affiliation with MicroWarehouse, (see Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions), he is deemed to be a ""non-independent"" director. As permitted under the Nasdaq requirements, the Board carefully considered Mr. York's affiliation with MicroWarehouse as well as his accounting and financial expertise and determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders that he continue to serve as a member of the Audit Committee. Both Mr. Campbell and Dr. Levinson are independent directors.  The Audit, Compensation and Nominating Committees operate under written charters adopted by the Board. These charters are available on the Company's website at www.apple.com/investor.  Audit Committee Financial Expert   While more than one member of the Company's Audit Committee qualifies as an ""audit committee financial expert"" under Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K, Mr. William V. Campbell, the Committee chairperson, is the designated audit committee financial expert. Mr. Campbell is considered ""independent"" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act.  Code of Ethics   The Company has a code of ethics that applies to all of the Company's employees, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. A copy of this code, ""Ethics: The Way We Do Business Worldwide"" is available on the Company's website at www.apple.com/investor and is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company intends to disclose any  105     changes in or waivers from its code of ethics by posting such information on its website or by filing a Form 8-K.

(2)In December 1999, Mr. Jobs was given a special executive bonus for past services as the Company's interim Chief Executive Officer, in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90,000,000. Because the aircraft was transferred to Mr. Jobs in 2001, the amount of approximately $43.5 million paid by the Company during fiscal year 2001 towards the purchase of the plane and the related tax assistance of approximately $40.5 million was reported as income to Mr. Jobs.

In March 2003, Mr. Jobs voluntarily cancelled all of his outstanding options, excluding those granted to him in his capacity as a director.   Director Compensation   The form and amount of director compensation is determined by the Board after a review of recommendations made by the Nominating Committee. The current practice of the Board is that a substantial portion of a director's annual retainer be equity-based. In 1998, shareholders approved the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan (the ""Director Plan"") and 800,000 shares were reserved for issuance thereunder. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Company's non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of Common Stock upon their initial election to the Board (""Initial Options""). The Initial Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee director's initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock (""Annual Options""). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. As of the end of the fiscal year, there were options for 370,000 shares outstanding under the Director Plan. Since accepting the position of CEO, Mr. Jobs is no longer eligible for grants under the Director Plan. Directors also receive a $50,000 annual retainer paid in quarterly increments. Directors do not receive any additional consideration for serving on committees or as committee chairperson.  Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation   The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. William V. Campbell, Millard S. Drexler, Albert Gore, Jr. and Dr. Arthur B. Levinson, none of whom are employees of the Company and all of whom are considered ""independent"" directors under the applicable NASDAQ rules. At the beginning of the fiscal year, Mr. Jerome B. York served on the Committee until his resignation in November 2002 at which time Mr. Drexler was appointed as a member of the Committee. No person who  108     was an employee of the Company in fiscal year 2003 served on the Compensation Committee. No executive officer of the Company (i) served as a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee, (ii) served as a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee, or (iii) served as a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of the Company.      Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management      The following table sets forth certain information as of October 31, 2003 (the ""Table Date"") with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company's Common Stock by (i) each person the Company believes beneficially holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock; (ii) each director; (iii) each Named Executive Officer listed in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading ""Executive Compensation;"" and (iv) all directors and executive officers as a group.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance   Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders also are required by rules promulgated by the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  Based solely upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company or written representations that no Forms 5 were required, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were met during fiscal year 2003, except that Messrs. Campbell and York each filed one Form 4 late under the new two-day reporting requirements.

(2)On October 22, 2003, the Company granted 6,697,368 shares under the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the ""1997 Plan"") pursuant to the stock option exchange program (see Part II, Item 8 of this  110      Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8, under the heading ""Employee Stock Option Exchange Program""). Following that grant, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan, its only non-shareholder approved equity plan. All remaining unissued shares in that plan were cancelled and no new options can be granted under that plan.    (3)This table does not include 160,975 outstanding options assumed in connection with mergers with and acquisitions of the companies which originally established those plans. These assumed options have a weighted average exercise price of $3.69 per share. No additional options may be granted under those assumed plans.  Arrangements with Named Executive Officers   Change In Control ArrangementsStock Options   In the event of a ""change in control"" of the Company, all outstanding options under the Company's stock option plans, except the Director Plan, will, unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator, become exercisable in full, and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable ""change in control price"" and the exercise price. The Director Plan provides that upon a ""change in control"" of the Company, all unvested options held by non-employee directors will automatically become fully vested and exercisable and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable ""change in control price"" and the exercise price of the options. A ""change in control"" under these plans is generally defined as (i) the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities or (ii) the occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.  In addition, options granted to the Named Executive Officers generally provide that in the event there is a ""change in control,"" as defined in the Company's stock option plans, and if in connection with or following such ""change in control,"" their employment is terminated without ""Cause"" or if they should resign for ""Good Reason,"" those options outstanding that are not yet vested and exercisable as of the date of such ""change in control"" shall become fully vested and exercisable. Generally, ""Cause"" is defined to include a felony conviction, willful disclosure of confidential information or willful and continued failure to perform his or her employment duties. ""Good Reason"" includes resignation of employment as a result of a substantial diminution in position or duties, or an adverse change in title or reduction in annual base salary.      Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions      In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Johnson (Senior Vice President, Retail) $1,500,000 for the purchase of his principal residence. The loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. The largest amount of the indebtedness outstanding on this loan during fiscal year 2003 was $1,500,000. Mr. Johnson repaid the Company $750,000 during the fiscal year and the amount remaining on the loan is $750,000.  Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (""MicroWarehouse"") in January 2000. Until September 2003, he served as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a reseller of computer hardware, software and peripheral products, including products made by the Company. During fiscal year 2003, MicroWarehouse accounted for 2.4% of the Company's net sales. The Company also purchased products from MicroWarehouse for its own internal use.  111      In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. During 2003, the Company recognized a total of $403,766 in expenses pursuant to this reimbursement agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2003.      Item 14.

The Company does not engage KPMG to perform personal tax services for its executive officers.   Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Performed by the Independent Auditors   Prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the ""Act""), the Company adopted an auditor independence policy that banned its auditors from performing non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This auditor policy also mandates that an annual budget for both audit and non-audit services be approved by the Audit Committee in advance, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that no auditor engagements for non-audit services may be entered into without the express approval of the Audit Committee.  112            PART IV          Item 15.

"Item 1 of this document under the heading ""Business.""  The Company's business strategy leverages its unique ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration and innovative industrial design.  The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Macintosh line of computers, consumer electronics with its iPod line of digital music players and distribution of third-party digital music through its online iTunes Music Store. While the Company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer market as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital music, these are highly competitive markets that are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. In order to remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development (R&D) is necessary in order to maintain and extend its position in the markets where it competes. The Company's R&D spending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its existing line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software applications and portable music players; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas such as rack-mount servers, RAID storage systems, and wireless technologies.  The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the seamless compatibility of the Macintosh with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes that providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 86 stores open as of September 25, 2004.  The Company has also staffed selected third-party stores with the Company's own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees in reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan and Australia. The Company also sells to customers direct through one of its online stores around the world.  To improve the accessibility of its iPod product line, the Company has significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold. The iPod product line can now be purchased in department stores, discount stores and specialty music and audio-visual stores.  24       Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.  Management believes the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and exposures related to inventory purchase commitments, valuation of long-lived assets including acquired intangibles, warranty costs, and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition   Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (i.e., hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable.  The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.  25       Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.  Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments   The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded.  The Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangibles   The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of  26      the assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in the Company's business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores, could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods in which such business issues are identified.  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the Company's business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which the goodwill relates; and (3) the Company determine the book value of those reporting units. If the estimated fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in-process research and development and developed technology. Once this process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be determined.  Based on the Company's estimates as of September 25, 2004 there was no impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including changes in the Company's market capitalization, changes in the Company's forecasts, and changes in the Company's internal business structure could cause one or more of the Company's reporting units to be valued differently thereby causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill.  Warranty Costs   The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company's results of operations.  Income Taxes   The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.  Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax  27       liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position.

(g)Net sales per Macintosh unit sold is derived by dividing total Macintosh net sales by total Macintosh unit sales.  Fiscal Year 2004 versus 2003   During fiscal 2004, net sales increased 33% or $2.1 billion from fiscal 2003. Several factors have contributed favorably to net sales during 2004:    Net sales of Macintosh systems increased $432 million or 10% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 while net sales per Macintosh unit sold remained relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 278,000 units or 9% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. These increases in net sales and unit sales were a result of strong demand for all of the Company's Macintosh systems, except for the iMac. The Company's portable systems, consisting of the PowerBook and iBook, produced the strongest revenue and unit growth during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 of approximately 26% and 33%, respectively. Unit sales of portable systems accounted for 51% of all Macintosh systems sold during fiscal 2004 compared to only 42% during 2003. The Company believes that these results reflect an overall trend in the industry towards portable systems. Performance of the Company's Power Macintosh systems also yielded positive results in fiscal 2004, including a 15% and 6% increase in net sales and unit sales, respectively. The increase in year-to-date Power Macintosh sales is due primarily to the introduction of the Power Mac G5, which began shipping at the end of fiscal 2003. Although Power Macintosh sales have increased from the prior year, sales of this product were constrained in the second half of 2004 as a result of manufacturing problems at IBM, the Company's sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor. Net sales of iPods rose $961 million or 279% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales of iPods totaled 4.4 million in fiscal 2004, which represents an increase of 370% from the 939,000 iPod units sold in fiscal 2003. Strong demand for the iPods during fiscal 2004 continued to be   29        experienced in all of the Company's operating segments and was driven by enhancements to the iPod, the introduction of the iPod mini, increased expansion of the Company's iPod distribution network, and continued success of the iTunes Music Store due largely to making it available to both Macintosh and Windows users in the U.S., U.K., France and Germany. Since inception of the iPod product line in fiscal 2002, the Company has sold approximately 5.7 million iPods.    The Retail segment's net sales grew 91% to $1.2 billion during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. This increase is largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 65 at the end of 2003 to 86 at the end of 2004, as well as a 36% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store. While the Company's customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Company's preexisting sales channels in the U.S. and Japan, the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segment's net sales is incremental to the Company's total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading ""Segment Operating Performance."" Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 38% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer accessories. Net sales of other computer accessories include AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital video cameras, and third party hardware products. The increase in total net sales of peripherals and other hardware is related to the overall increase in Macintosh unit sales and the introduction of new and updated peripheral products and was experienced predominantly by the Company's Americas, Europe, and Retail segments. Other music products consists of sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod related services and accessories. Net sales of other music products increased $242 million or 672% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. The Company has experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit sales for fiscal 2004. The increased sales from the iTunes Music Store, which was originally introduced in April 2003, is primarily due to making the store available for Windows in October 2003 and the introduction of the store in the U.K., France, and Germany in June 2004. Net sales of software rose $140 million or 39% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to higher net sales of the Company's Apple-branded software and in particular, higher net sales of the Company's operating system software, Mac OS X version 10.3 ""Panther,"" which was released in October 2003. Net sales of Panther accounted for approximately $74 million or over 50% of the increase in software net sales for fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. The Company's U.S. education channel experienced year-over-year growth in net sales of approximately 19% for fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales also increased by 10% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in U.S. education net sales for fiscal 2004 relates primarily to a 40% year-over-year increase in higher education net sales and to a lesser extent the Company's 3% growth in K-12 net sales.   The Company believes the U.S. K-12 education market remains challenging due to multiple factors including funding pressures due to weak economic conditions, large budget deficits in many states, and increased competition particularly for desktop computers. Although the Company has taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to address weakness in the U.S. education channel, it remains difficult to anticipate when and if this trend will reverse.  Service and other sales increased $37 million or 13% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. These increases are the result of significant year-over-year increases in net sales associated with AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended maintenance and support services, as well as increases in net sales associated with the Company's .Mac Internet service. Increased net sales associated with APP are primarily the result of higher Macintosh unit sales and higher attach rates on APP over the last several years.   30             Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales during fiscal 2004 were negatively impacted by the following:    Net sales and unit sales of iMac systems were down 23% and 16%, respectively, during fiscal 2004 versus 2003. The decrease in iMac net sales and unit sales was largely due to the delay in the introduction of the new iMac, based on the PowerPC G5 processor, primarily as a result of manufacturing problems experienced by IBM. The delays in the new iMac resulted in the depletion of inventory of the old iMac flat panel prior to availability of the new iMac G5. The old flat panel iMac form factor which was available during most of fiscal 2004, was nearly 3 years old by the time the new iMac G5 began shipping in September 2004 and had experienced declines in sales as a result of the age of this product. The Company believes that sales of iMac systems have also declined due to a shift in consumer preference to portable systems and competitor desktop models with price points below $1,000. The Company introduced a new version of the eMac in April 2004 with a suggested retail price starting at $799 aimed at the price sensitive customer. Net sales and unit sales in the Company's Japan segment decreased 3% and 14%, respectively, during fiscal 2004 versus 2003. The Company believes these declines relate to a shift in sales from the Japan Segment to the Retail segment as a result of the Tokyo and Osaka store openings in fiscal 2004. Declines in Japan may also relate to delays in computer upgrades by certain professional and creative customers pending release in Japan of certain Mac OS X native applications, such as Quark Xpress 6, which did not become available until September 2004. When sales from the Japan retail stores are included in the results for the Japan segment, the combined revenue in Japan resulted in a 3% year-over-year increase in fiscal 2004 as compared to 2003. See additional comments below related to the Japan segment under the heading ""Segment Operating Performance.""   Fiscal Year 2003 versus 2002   Net sales increased $465 million or 8% during 2003 compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined 3% year-over-year to approximately 3 million units in 2003. Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2003 including:    The Retail segment's net sales grew to $621 million during 2003 from $283 million in 2002, an increase of 119%. While the Company's customers may have elected to purchase product from their local Apple Retail store rather than through other preexisting sales channels in the U.S., the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segment's net sales was incremental to total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading ""Segment Operating Performance."" Net sales of iPods rose $202 million or 141% during 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was experienced by all of the Company's operating segments. iPod sales during 2003 were favorably affected by the introduction of substantially redesigned new models, which were compatible with both Macintosh and Windows operating systems. The Company's iPod digital music player is sold by a variety of resellers, many of which do not currently market the Company's Macintosh systems. The Company expanded this distribution network during 2003, which contributed to the 2003 increase in iPod unit sales of 146%. The Company also experienced an increase in net sales of peripherals and other hardware totaling $164 million or 31% during 2003 compared to 2002, reflecting an overall increase in net sales of other computer accessories including AirPort cards and base stations, which facilitate wireless connectivity; third party digital cameras and printers; and a number of portable computer related accessories. Net sales of other music products, including sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod related services and accessories, increased $32 million or 800% during 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was due primarily to the introduction of the iTunes Music Store for the Macintosh   31        operating system in April 2003 and higher sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in iPod net sales and unit sales during 2003.    Although total Macintosh unit sales were down 3% in 2003, unit sales of the Company's portable systems were relatively strong primarily due to the 69% or 247,000 unit increase in PowerBook unit sales, slightly offset by a 4% or 30,000 unit decrease in iBook unit sales. The increase in PowerBook net sales of $468 million or 56% was due primarily to the success of the Company's new 12-inch, 15-inch and 17-inch models that were introduced during 2003. The decline in iBook consumer portable sales during 2003 was primarily due to a lower average price per unit. Portable systems represented 42% of all Macintosh systems sold in 2003 versus 33% in 2002, which reflected an overall industry trend towards portable systems. The Company's average net sales per Macintosh unit sold increased 2% to $1,491 in 2003 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix towards relatively higher-priced PowerBook systems and increases direct sales primarily from the Company's retail and online stores, offset by somewhat lower year-over-year pricing on comparable Macintosh systems for most of the Company's Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure, particularly with the Company's iBook consumer portable systems. PowerBook and Power Macintosh systems accounted for 42% of total unit sales in 2003 versus 36% in 2002. Net sales of software increased $55 million or 18% during 2003 compared to the prior year and reflected higher net sales of Apple-branded application and server software and third-party software. Net sales of Apple-branded application and server software increased due to the introduction of several new software titles during fiscal 2003 including Final Cut Express, iLife, and Keynote, as well as from higher sales of software related to recent acquisitions including PowerSchool and Emagic. Growth in net sales of third-party software during 2003 was particularly strong in the Americas Segment due to strong sales of software by the Company's online store and its Retail segment. Service and other sales rose $55 million or 24% during 2003 which primarily resulted from significant year-over-year increases in net sales associated with APP extended maintenance and support services, as well as the Company's Internet related services. Increased net sales associated with APP were primarily the result of increasing attach rates over the last several years. Increased net sales associated with Internet services were due to increased net sales of the Company's .Mac Internet service.   Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales during 2003 were negatively impacted by the following factors:    Total unit sales of desktop systems fell 15% during 2003 compared to 2002. iMac systems unit sales declined 16% from 2003 to 2002 resulting from a shift in sales away from desktop systems in favor of portables. Also, the flat panel iMac form factor available during fiscal 2003 was in the eighth quarter of its life cycle by the end of 2003. Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. For the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems decreased 24%, which was representative of the decline of Power Macintosh systems sales experienced by the Company during recent years and was also believed to be attributable to delays in purchasing pending the release of the Power Mac G5. As expected, this trend reversed in the fourth quarter of 2003 with unit sales increasing 26% during the quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year due largely to the new Power Mac G5, which the Company introduced in June 2003 and began shipping at the end of fiscal 2003. The decline in Power Macintosh sales over the previous several years also reflects the shift in sales to portable systems, particularly PowerBooks. In addition, the Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past   32        several years had a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers. Additionally, some of the Company's professional and creative customers may have delayed upgrades of their systems in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software applications to run natively on Mac OS X.    The Company experienced ongoing weakness in its U.S. education channel during 2003. Net sales and unit sales in U.S. education during 2003 were down 4% and 6%, respectively, as compared to 2002. This decline was due to a decrease in K-12 sales, partially offset by an increase in higher education sales. Net sales declined primarily as a result of a continued shift in mix away from higher priced Power Macintosh and iMac systems towards lower priced eMac and iBook systems, although the Company did experience a significant increase in sales of its PowerBook systems primarily to higher education customers. Portable systems accounted for approximately 43% of total unit sales in the education channel during 2003, as compared to approximately 34% in 2002.   Segment Operating Performance   The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan and excludes revenue from the Company's own retail stores in Japan, which is included in the Company's Retail segment. The Retail segment operated Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and Japan during fiscal 2004. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, ""Segment Information and Geographic Data.""  Americas   During fiscal 2004, net sales in the Americas segment grew 26% or $838 million compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in net sales during 2004 was primarily attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod sales as well as strong sales of peripherals, software, and services. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which had 84 stores in the U.S. as of the end of fiscal 2004. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 4% in fiscal 2004 compared to 2003, driven primarily by strong sales of portable and Power Macintosh systems, partially offset by continued weakness in iMac sales. During 2004 and 2003, the Americas segment represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales and represented approximately 51% and 54%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. As noted above, the Company experienced an increase in U.S. education channel net sales of 19% for fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Strong U.S. education net sales for the current year relate primarily to strength in higher education net sales that resulted from a successful back-to-school selling season with strong demand for the Company's portables. This strength drove year-over-year growth in net sales of 40% for the higher education channel during fiscal 2004. The Company's K-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 3% during fiscal 2004, despite the challenges in the K-12 market from continued budget constraints and increased competition, due to the Company's continued focus and success with delivering 1:1 education solutions.  Net sales in the Americas segment during 2003 increased $50 million or 2% compared to 2002. During 2003 and 2002, the Americas segment represented approximately 51% and 55%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales and represented approximately 54% and 56%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The results of the Americas segment are similar to the overall results of the Company as they reflect substantially lower unit sales and net sales of Power Macintosh systems and iMac systems, partially offset by increases in unit sales and net sales of PowerBooks. The net sales of the Americas segment, and the Company in total, also reflect substantially higher sales of iPods, peripherals, software, and services during 2003 compared to 2002. The Americas segment had been negatively affected by weakness in its U.S. education channel during 2003. Total net sales and unit sales in the U.S. education channel during 2003  33       were down 4% and 6%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2002. The Company believes this decline was caused by increased competition in the education market and by a reduction in spending by U.S. educational institutions due to federal and state funding concerns and tax revenue shortfalls resulting from the weak economy. Additionally, some of the decline during 2003 in net sales and unit sales of Macintosh systems in the Americas segment may be the result of the operation of the Company's Retail segment whose net sales, all of which occurred within the U.S., increased significantly during 2003.  Europe   Net sales in Europe rebounded in fiscal 2004 increasing $490 million or 37% from 2003. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing 13% in fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales across all product lines, except for the iMac systems. Demand in Europe during fiscal 2004 was particularly strong for the Company's Power Macintosh systems and portable Macintosh systems, which experienced year-over-year increases of 29% and 42%, respectively. Similar to the results of the Company's other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in fiscal 2004.  Net sales in Europe increased $58 million or 5% during 2003 as compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined by 5% during the same period. Europe's operating results were consistent with the trend experienced in the Americas and by the Company as a whole. Europe experienced weakened demand for Power Macintosh, iMac and iBook systems in 2003, partially offset by strong demand for PowerBooks whose net sales increased by 48% or $100 million from 2002. Europe also realized increased sales of iPods, peripherals, software, and services.  Japan   The Japan segment continues to be a challenge for the Company, with four consecutive years of year-over-year declines in both net sales and Macintosh unit sales. Japan's net sales and unit sales were down 3% and 14%, respectively during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003, continuing to lag behind all of the Company's other operating segments. These decreases in net sales and unit sales are believed to be attributable in part to a shift in sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening of two stores in Japan in fiscal 2004. In addition, such decreases may have been related to delayed computer system upgrades by some professional and creative customers who were awaiting the release of Quark XPress 6 for Mac OS X, which did not occur until September 2004. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by strong iPod and iBook sales during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003.  Net sales in Japan decreased $12 million or 2% during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002, the weakest year-to-date performance of any of the Company's operating segments. Japan's Macintosh unit sales were particularly weak in 2003, declining 12%, and were primarily attributable to lower sales of iMac and iBook systems, partially offset by an increase in PowerBook sales as well as higher sales of iPods, and peripherals and other hardware. Japan's Macintosh unit sales remained significantly below the segment's historic levels due to economic conditions that remained particularly negative in Japan.  Retail   The Company opened 21 new retail stores during 2004, including its first two international stores in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, bringing the total number of open stores to 86 as of September 25, 2004. This compares to 65 open stores as of September 27, 2003 and 40 open stores as of September 28, 2002. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company anticipates opening approximately 14 additional stores to end the calendar year at approximately 100 stores. Approximately half of the stores expected to open during the first quarter of 2005 will be in the new ""mini"" store design, which is the Company's smallest store format to date; allowing it to be placed in a variety of new locations to introduce the Company's innovative products to even more customers. The Company also opened its third international store in London, England during the first quarter of 2005.  34      Net sales of the Retail segment grew to $1.185 billion during 2004 from $621 million and $283 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increases in net sales during both 2004 and 2003 reflect the impact of new store openings for each fiscal year, including the opening of 21 new stores in 2004 and 25 new stores in 2003. An increase in average revenue per store also contributed to the segment's strong sales in fiscal 2004. With an average of 76 stores open during 2004, the Retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $15.6 million, as compared to $11.5 million in 2003 with a 54 store average and $10.2 million in 2002 with a 28 store average.  As measured by the Company's operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported profit of $39 million during fiscal 2004 as compared to losses of $5 million and $22 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively. This improvement is primarily attributable to the segment's year-over-year increase in average quarterly revenue per store, the impact of opening new stores, and the segment's year-over-year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation and other fixed costs.  Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment were $104 million in fiscal 2004, bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the Retail segment to approximately $394 million. As of September 25, 2004, the Retail segment had approximately 2,100 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately $436 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.  Gross Margin   Gross margin for the three fiscal years ended September 25, 2004 are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):         2004   2003   2002     Net sales   $ 8,279   $ 6,207   $ 5,742     Cost of sales     6,020     4,499     4,139                    Gross margin   $ 2,259   $ 1,708   $ 1,603                    Gross margin percentage     27.3 %   27.5 %   27.9 %    Gross margin declined in fiscal 2004 to 27.3% of net sales from 27.5% of net sales in 2003. The Company's gross margin during fiscal 2004 declined due to an increase in mix towards lower margin iPod and iBook sales, pricing actions on certain Power Macintosh G5 models that were transitioned during the beginning of 2004, higher warranty costs on certain portable Macintosh products, and higher freight and duty costs during fiscal 2004. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increase in direct sales and a 39% year-over-year increase in higher margin software sales.  The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer and consumer electronics industries will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2005 in light of price competition, especially for the iPod product line. The Company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges, which negatively impact gross margins on the iMac and other products during the first quarter of 2005 and possibly beyond.  The foregoing statements regarding the Company's expected gross margin during 2005, general demand for personal computers, anticipated air freight charges, and future economic conditions are forward- looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained or targeted gross margin levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products, including iPods, will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide  35       global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.  The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Company's operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  Gross margin decreased to 27.5% of net sales in 2003 from 27.9% of net sales in 2002. This decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several Macintosh models instituted by the Company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry, lower sales of relatively higher margin Power Macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of 2003, and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of the new Power Mac G5 and 15-inch PowerBook, both of which began shipping in volume during September 2003. This decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed. The aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales.  Operating Expenses   Operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended September 25, 2004 are as follows (in millions, except for percentages):         2004   2003   2002     Research and development   $ 489   $ 471   $ 446       Percentage of net sales     6 %   8 %   8 %   Selling, general, and administrative expenses   $ 1,421   $ 1,212   $ 1,109       Percentage of net sales     17 %   20 %   19 %   Restructuring costs   $ 23   $ 26   $ 30     Purchased in-process research and development             $ 1      Research and Development (R&D)   The Company recognizes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. R&D expense amounted to approximately 6% of total net sales during fiscal 2004 down from 8% of total net sales in both 2003 and 2002. This decrease is due to the significant increase of 33% in total net sales of the Company for fiscal 2004. Although R&D expense decreased as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal 2004, actual expenditures for R&D in fiscal 2004 increased $18 million or 4% from fiscal 2003, which follows a 6% or $25 million increase in 2003 compared to 2002. The overall increase in R&D expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities and the impact of employee salary merit increases in 2004. R&D spending also included capitalized software development costs of approximately $4.5 million related to the  36      development of Mac OS X Tiger and $2.3 million related to the development of FileMaker Pro 7 in 2004; $14.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Panther in 2003; and approximately $13.3 million associated with the development of Mac OS X Jaguar and approximately $6 million associated with the PowerSchool enterprise student information system in 2002. Further information related to the Company's capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)   Expenditures for SG&A increased $209 million or 17% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases are due primarily to the Company's continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, an increase in amortization costs associated with restricted stock compensation, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2004 was 17%, down from 20% in 2003. This decrease is due to the increase of 33% in total net sales of the Company for fiscal 2004, reflecting leverage on the Company's fixed costs.  SG&A increased $103 million or 9% during 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to the Company's continued expansion of the Retail segment and increases in headcount. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in 2003 discretionary spending on marketing and advertising and by savings resulting from the 2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described below.  Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions   The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during the year ended September 25, 2004, including approximately $14 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $23 million charge, $14.3 million had been spent by the end of 2004, with the remaining $8.7 million consisting of $5.2 million for employee severance benefits and $3.5 million for lease cancellations.  During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $5.5 million. In conjunction with the European workforce reduction during the second quarter of 2004, the Company vacated a leased sales facility during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting in a charge of $3.7 million for contract termination and asset impairment costs. The Company also recognized employee termination costs of $1.8 million related to the elimination of non-essential positions, principally in Europe. In addition, the Company reversed $400,000 of excess restructuring expense from prior periods related primarily to lower than expected disposal costs on Sacramento manufacturing-related fixed assets. The net cost of the restructuring plans for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $5.1 million, of which $300,000 had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 54 positions, 4 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2004.  During the third quarter of 2004, the Company finalized restructuring plans related to closing Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento. In addition, the Company's management approved restructuring plans related to certain headcount reductions primarily for various sales and marketing activities principally in the U.S. Total cost of the restructuring plan for the third quarter of 2004 was $7.9 million, of which $7.2 million had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 83 positions, 77 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2004.  The closing of manufacturing operations in Sacramento resulted in the elimination of 67 positions for a severance cost of $1.9 million and write-off of $5.3 million in manufacturing-related fixed assets whose use ceased during the third quarter of 2004. Termination of sales and marketing activities, principally in the U.S., resulted in severance of $0.7 million for the elimination of 16 positions.  During the second quarter of 2004, the Company's management approved restructuring plans related to the termination of Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento and headcount reductions  37       related primarily to various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. Total cost of the actions was $9.6 million for the termination of 348 positions. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, $6.8 million had been spent and 310 positions had been eliminated related to these actions.  The Company estimates the closing of the Sacramento manufacturing operations will result in reduced ongoing quarterly operating expenses of approximately $2 million. In addition, the Company estimates that the remaining restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2004 will ultimately result in reduced ongoing quarterly operating expenses of approximately $6 million.  Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions   The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been spent by the end of 2004, except for approximately $3.0 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and an approximately $500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense.  During the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including $2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees.  During the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide.  Closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and marketing activities and employees, principally in the U.S. and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities of $6.7 million. The total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.  Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions   During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Company's operating expenses with  38      existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail operating segment.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000.  Purchased In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)   During 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately $30 million in cash; $551,000 of which was allocated to IPR&D. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%.  Other Income and Expense   Other income and expense for the three fiscal years ended September 25, 2004 are as follows (in millions):         2004   2003   2002     Gains (losses) on non-current investments, net   $ 4   $ 10   $ (42 )                   Interest income   $  64   $  69   $  118     Interest expense     (3 )   (8 )   (11 )   Gains on sales of short term investments, net     1     21     7     Other income (expense), net     (9 )   (5 )   (2 )   Gain on forward purchase agreement          6                         Interest and other income, net   $ 53   $ 83   $ 112                    Total other income and expense   $ 57   $ 93   $ 70                     39      Gains and Losses on Non-current Investments   Over the course of the last three years, the Company has held investments that were classified as available-for-sale in EarthLink Inc. (EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM) and certain investments in private companies. Further information related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  During 2004, the Company sold its remaining 986,000 shares of Akamai stock. The transaction generated proceeds of approximately $5 million and a gain before taxes of approximately $4 million. As of September 25, 2004, the Company does not have any non-current public company investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet.  During 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $9 million, and a gain before taxes of approximately $8 million. Additionally, the Company sold its remaining investment in ARM stock, 278,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of $270,000, and sold its remaining investment in EarthLink stock, 6,540,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $37 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million.  During 2002, the Company determined that declines in the fair value of certain investments were other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in EarthLink, a $6 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in Akamai, and a $15 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in a private company investment. These losses in 2002 were partially offset by the sale of 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000, the sale of 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000, and the sale of approximately 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million.  Interest and Other Income, Net   Total interest and other income, net decreased $30 million or 36% to $53 million during fiscal 2004 compared to $83 million in 2003 and $112 million in 2002. These decreases are attributable primarily to declining investment yields on the Company's cash and short-term investments resulting from lower market interest and a shortening of the average maturity of the Company's investment portfolio, as well as lower gains on sales of short-term investments in fiscal 2004. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 1.38% in 2004 compared to the 1.89% and 2.85% rates earned during 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of $1 million, $21 million and $7 million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in total interest and other income, net during fiscal 2003 was also offset by the $6 million gain related to the forward purchase agreement during the fourth quarter of 2003 which is further discussed below under the heading ""Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes.""  Interest expense consisted primarily of interest on the Company's $300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004, partially offset by amortization of deferred gains realized in 2002 and 2001 that resulted from the closure of swap positions associated with the unsecured notes. The unsecured notes were sold at 99.925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized as of the notes' maturity in February 2004.  Provision for Income Taxes   The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended September 25, 2004 was approximately 28%. The Company's effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to  40      be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $647 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. As of September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2001 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.  Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes   Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity   On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment represented the mark-to-market adjustment to fair value for a forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at a price of $16.64 per share. The Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003. The settlement resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million, which is included in interest and other income, net.  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations   On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during 2003 of approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which supercedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104 clarifies existing guidance regarding revenue contracts that contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 00-21. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.  41      In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 46R, a revision to FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is effective at the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.  In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-1-1, which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 to investments in securities that are impaired; however, the disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of EITF 03-1, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as further discussed in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.  On March 31, 2004, the FASB issued a proposed Statement, Share-Based Payment, that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The proposed Statement would eliminate the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25 and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. If adopted, it is currently anticipated that the proposed Statement would be effective for the Company beginning in its fourth fiscal quarter of 2005.  At the Company's annual shareholders meeting on April 24, 2003, shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the Company's Board of Directors (the Board) establish a policy of expensing the value of all future employee stock options issued by the Company. The Board and management appreciate and take seriously the views expressed by the Company's shareholders. The Company decided not to expense the value of employee stock options until the FASB finalizes its new accounting standard on the matter, which may play a significant role in determining the fair value of and accounting for employee stock options. The Company monitors progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to the general issue of employee stock compensation. The Company is currently reviewing the potential impact from the guidance of the proposed statement, which may require the Company to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future results of operations. The accounting impact had the Company chosen to apply the fair-value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, instead of the recognition provisions under APB Opinion No. 25, is described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  42       Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions):         2004   2003   2002   Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments   $ 5,464   $ 4,566   $ 4,337   Accounts receivable, net   $ 774   $ 766   $ 565   Inventory   $ 101   $ 56   $ 45   Working capital   $ 4,375   $ 3,530   $ 3,730   Days sales in accounts receivable (DSO) (a)     30     41     36   Days of supply in inventory (b)     5     4     4   Days payables outstanding (DPO) (c)     76     82     77   Annual operating cash flow   $ 934   $ 289   $ 89       (a)DSO is based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b)Days supply of inventory is based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. (c)DPO is based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales adjusted for the change in inventory.   As of September 25, 2004, the Company had $5.464 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $898 million over the same balances at the end of fiscal 2003. The principal components of this increase were cash generated by operating activities of $934 million and proceeds of $427 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, partially offset by cash used to repay the Company's outstanding debt of $300 million and purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $176 million. The Company's short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid investments. Approximately $3.2 billion of this cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the one-time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate earnings from some of its foreign subsidiaries.  The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.  Debt   In February 2004, the Company retired $300 million of debt outstanding in the form of 6.5% unsecured notes. The notes were originally issued in 1994 and were sold at 99.9925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The Company currently has no long-term debt obligations.  Capital Expenditures   The Company's total capital expenditures were $176 million during fiscal 2004, $104 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Company's Retail segment and $72 million of which were primarily for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $240 million for capital expenditures during 2005, approximately $125 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Company's Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure.  43         Stock Repurchase Plan   In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.  During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81. Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was still authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 25, 2004.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.  The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 25, 2004 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Company's balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions):         TOTAL   Payments Due in Less Than 1 year   Payments Due in 1-3 years   Payments Due in 4-5 years   Payments Due in More Than 5 years   Operating Leases   $ 617   $ 89   $ 170   $ 126   $ 232   Purchase Obligations     1,112     1,112                  Asset Retirement Obligations     12          1     2     9   Other Obligations     24     14     10                                Total   $ 1,765   $ 1,215   $ 181   $ 128   $ 241                       Lease Commitments   As of September 25, 2004, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $617 million, $436 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Company's existing operating leases range from 2 to 16 years.  Purchase Obligations   The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The nature of the Company's outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments has not changed significantly since the end of its fiscal 2003. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had  44      outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $1.1 billion.  Asset Retirement Obligations   The Company's asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 25, 2004, the Company estimates that gross expected future cash flows of approximately $12 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.  Other Obligations   The Company's other obligations of approximately $24 million are primarily related to telecommunications services.  Indemnifications   The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse affect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition   Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Company's products and the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.   The Company's operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. Over the past several years, demand for the Company's products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some of the Company's education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding. Although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery, continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the Company's products and related operating results. Should global and/or regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Company's products could be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.  War, terrorism, public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products, which could negatively affect the Company's operations and performance.   War, terrorism, public health issues and other business interruptions whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could continue to cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Company's suppliers or customers. The Company's major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical conditions, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near  45      major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster.  Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Company's products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues, including epidemics, arise the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company's manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these events.  The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related services, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected.   The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense. The Company's competitors who sell Windows and Linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to the weakness in demand that began in the second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing products. The Company's results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.  The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Company's key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Company's competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products and/or online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Company's products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Company's markets.  The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing other competing operating systems, including Windows and Linux. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms.  46       The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices, including iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products and distribution services and free peer-to-peer music services. These competitors include both new entrants with novel market approaches, such as subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have greater technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than those of the Company, as well as established hardware, software and music content supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Company's operating results and financial position. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell digital music outside the U.S. The Company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices and/or increasing features which could adversely affect the Company's music product gross margins as well as overall Company gross margins.  The Company also faces increased competition in the U.S. education market. Sales in the U.S. to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and university customers, remain a core market for the Company. Uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers, which could negatively affect the Company's market share. In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in education. The Company's 1:1 learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook portable system for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. These 1:1 learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.  The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand.   Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Company's existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations.  The Company's products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits.   The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain ""bugs"" that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third-parties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells.  47      Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy.  Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.   The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  Future operating results are dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources.   Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers' yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (formerly the Semiconductor Products Segment of Motorola, Inc.), the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz  48       rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Company's suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Company's results of operations. In addition, IBM is currently the Company's sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor, which is used in the Company's current Power Mac, Xserve, and iMac products. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. is the sole supplier of the G4 processor, which is used in the Company's eMac and portable products. IBM has recently experienced manufacturing problems with the PowerPC G5 processor, which resulted in the Company delaying the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of 2004. The inability of IBM to remedy these problems in a timely manner, avoid manufacturing problems in the future, and to deliver to the Company microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could further constrain shipments of products containing the G5 processor and could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.  The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S.   Most of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition.  Final assembly of products sold by the Company is currently conducted in the Company's manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Company's products and final assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan and China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by events such as regional economic, business, environmental, medical, political, information technology system failures, or military actions, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The Company's future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products.   The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores. Many of the Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to  49      reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company employees. These programs could require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment.  Over the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Company's net sales have been made by the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the U.S. and Japan. Some of the Company's resellers have perceived this expansion of the Company's direct sales as conflicting with their own business and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the Company's products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Company's resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Company's products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Company's products. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Company's products.  Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading ""Markets and Distribution.""  The Company relies on third-party music content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.   The Company contracts with third parties to offer their music content to customers through the Company's iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third-party music. Many of the Company's licensing arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have announced their intent to consolidate their music distribution operations, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer music content to customers through the iTunes Music Store. Further, some third-party content providers currently, or may in the future, offer music products and services that compete with the Company's music products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their music content in the future. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins of the Company's iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected.  Third-party content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial position.  The Company's future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the Company's hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.   The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such  50      software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company's operating system, on a timely basis or at all.  In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Company's products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence the decisions of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database management, and high-quality presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application.  In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft has not been obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system and competing digital media applications, including music distribution service and technology. In June of 2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet Explorer for the Mac OS, subsequent to the Company's introduction during 2003 of its own web browser, Safari. Further discontinuance of products for the Macintosh platform, including Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products could have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and results of operations.  The Company's business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company's future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.   Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms.  Because of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual  51       property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company's future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  The Company's retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.   Through September 2004, the Company has opened 86 retail stores. The Company's retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 16 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segment's costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason.  Certain of the Company's stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Company's more typical retail stores. The Company has opened seven such stores through November 2004. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 16 years with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.  Many of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could adversely affect the Retail segment's future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of the Company's retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience  52       in managing retail operations outside the U.S.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost.  Investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company's ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated.   The Company may decide to invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the Company's strategic direction and product roadmap. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management's attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company's due diligence process. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the Company's business, operating results or financial condition.  Declines in the sales of the Company's professional products or increases in sales of consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the Company's gross margin and operating margin percentages   Unit sales of the Company's professional products, including Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems, generally have higher gross margins than the Company's consumer products, including iMacs, iBooks, iPods, and content from the iTunes Music Store. A shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the Company's future gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Company's traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac G5 and iBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy the iMac G5 due to its relative price performance, use of the same PowerPC G5 processor used in the Company's Power Macs, and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. Potential PowerBook customers may also choose to purchase iBooks instead due to their price performance and screen size. Additionally, significant future growth in iPod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages.  The Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are significant users of its professional systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Company's current and potential professional, creative, and small business customers, who are most likely to utilize professional systems, believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the Company utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer manufacturers and translates to slower overall system performance. These factors may result in an adverse impact to sales of the Company's professional products as well as to gross margin and operating margin percentages.  The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.   The Company's profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company's direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have higher associated profitability than its indirect sales. Additionally, the Company's direct channels have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products, which generally have higher gross margins, than through its indirect channels. As a result, the Company's gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix. In addition, the Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company's ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition.  53      The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors.   The Company's ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Company's Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Company's brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure.  The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.   The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.  The Company's success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.   Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Company's key employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the Company's future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel.  The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.   The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional commercial insurance. Such conditions have and may continue to result in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.  Failure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the Company relies could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.   Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company's ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer  54      orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the Company or a third-party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.  The Company's business is subject to the risks of international operations.   A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the Company's results of operations.  Margins on sales of the Company's products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  Derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.  Further information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading ""Foreign Currency Risk"" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.   Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse affect on the Company.  Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.   Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including the FASB and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who interpret and create appropriate accounting regulations. A change from current accounting regulations, including accounting for stock-based compensation, could have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations and could impact the manner in which the Company conducts business.  55      Unanticipated changes in the Company's tax rates could affect its future results.   The Company's future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition.  The Company's stock price may be volatile.   The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive performance in the Company's stock price, as well as general economic and political conditions and investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company's stock in the future. In addition, increases in the Company's stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share.  56          Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management   The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial position.  Interest Rate Risk   While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  The Company's short-term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of current credit and interest rate trends. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Company's investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process.  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of September 25, 2004, approximately $180 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 27, 2003, $629 million of the Company's investment portfolio classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities, due to liquidity needs, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of $1 million in 2004, $21 million in 2003, and $7 million in 2002.  In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 25, 2004, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $14.4 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 27, 2003, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $12.9 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Company's policy is to hold investments to maturity.  From time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents  57       and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives during 2004 or 2003 and had no open interest rate derivatives at September 25, 2004.  In prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest rate debt swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2001 and 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out interest rate debt swap positions realizing gains of $23 million. The gains were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and were amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt.  Foreign Currency Risk   In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $3.2 million as of September 25, 2004 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $7.5 million as of September 27, 2003. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.  Actual gains and losses in the future associated with the Company's investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 25, 2004 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company's actual exposures and positions.  58             Item 8.

Basis of Presentation and Preparation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  Typically, the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. The Company expects to add this additional week in its first fiscal quarter of 2006. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar.  Financial Instruments   Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments   All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.  Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity   On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150,  Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment related to a forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003, which resulted in an additional gain of  64      approximately $6 million representing the increase in fair value of the agreement from June 29, 2003 through the settlement date.  Derivative Financial Instruments   The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current period.  In accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. For interest rate swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. For such contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency  65       translation adjustment. Any residual changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense.  Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.  Property, Plant, and Equipment   Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years.  Asset Retirement Obligations   On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. All of the Company's existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company estimated that as of September 29, 2002, gross expected future cash flows of $9.5 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.  As of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $6 million long-term asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold improvements. This amount represents the present value of expected future cash flows associated with returning certain of the Company's leased properties to original condition. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow of $9.5 million and its present value of $6 million at September 29, 2002, is being accreted over the life of the related leases as an operating expense. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during the first quarter of 2003 of approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.  66       The following table reconciles changes in the Company's asset retirement liabilities for fiscal 2003 and 2004 (in millions):     Asset retirement liability as of September 29, 2002   $ 5.5     Additional asset retirement obligations recognized     0.5     Accretion recognized     1.2          Asset retirement liability as of September 27, 2003   $ 7.2     Additional asset retirement obligations recognized     0.5     Accretion recognized     0.5          Asset retirement liability as of September 25, 2004   $ 8.2           Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets   The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002 the Company had no material impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2001, and its annual goodwill impairment tests on August 30 of each year thereafter and found no impairment. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.  SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.  Foreign Currency Translation   The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in ""accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)"" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and  67      losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations.  Revenue Recognition   Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition.  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable.  Revenue from extended warranty and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty and support periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, certain repairs, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the Company's one-year basic limited parts and labor warranty.  The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies at the gross amount billed.  Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, which is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. VSOE is determined based on the price charged when each element is sold separately.  The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience.  Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. However, a limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.  68       Shipping Costs   The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented.  Warranty Expense   The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.  Research and Development   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed.  During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.4 (code-named ""Tiger""), which enhances the features and functionality of the previous version of Mac OS X, subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration in August 2004 and subsequent release of a developer beta version of the product, both of which were prior to the planned release of the final version of the product in the first half of calendar year 2005. Therefore, during the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $4.5 million of costs associated with development of Tiger. Amortization of this asset will begin when Tiger begins shipping and will be recognized straight-line over a 3 year estimated useful life.  During the second quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the product in March 2004. Therefore, during the second quarter of 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset began in March 2004 when FileMaker Pro 7 was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named ""Panther""), subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million of development costs associated with the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset began in the first quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named ""Jaguar"") subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the fourth quarter of 2002. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth quarter of 2002 when Jaguar was  69       shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. In addition, during 2002, the Company also began capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization of approximately $6 million began upon achievement of technological feasibility in the first quarter of 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released in July 2002.  Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $10.7 million, $5.8 million, and $1.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Advertising Costs   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $206 million, $193 million, and $209 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  Restructuring Charges   In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring) and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. This Statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 were required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities.  Stock-Based Compensation   The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-based CompensationTransition and Disclosure as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.  As required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options and employee  70       stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares.  For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts):         2004   2003   2002     Net incomeas reported   $ 276   $ 69   $ 65      Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of tax      33      15      5     Deduct: Stock-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards, net of tax     (141 )   (181 )   (234 )                   Net income (loss)pro forma   $  168   $  (97 ) $  (164 )                   Net income per common shareas reported                            Basic   $ 0.74   $ 0.19   $ 0.18       Diluted   $ 0.71   $ 0.19   $ 0.18      Net income (loss) per common sharepro forma                            Basic   $ 0.45   $ (0.27 ) $ (0.46 )     Diluted   $ 0.44   $ (0.27 ) $ (0.46 )    Earnings Per Common Share   Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.  71      The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:     For the Years Ended    September 25, 2004   September 27, 2003   September 28, 2002   Numerator (in millions):                       Income before accounting changes   $ 276   $ 68   $ 65     Cumulative effects of accounting changes, net of tax          1                       Net income   $ 276   $ 69   $ 65                 Denominator (in thousands):                          Weighted-average shares outstanding, excluding unvested restricted stock     371,590     360,631     355,022     Effect of dilutive options, restricted stock units and restricted stock     15,721     2,835     6,763                  Denominator for diluted earnings per share     387,311     363,466     361,785                 Basic earnings per share before accounting changes   $  0.74   $  0.19   $  0.18   Cumulative effects of accounting changes, net of tax                               Basic earnings per share after accounting changes   $ 0.74   $ 0.19   $ 0.18                 Diluted earnings per share before accounting changes   $  0.71   $  0.19   $  0.18   Cumulative effects of accounting changes, net of tax                               Diluted earnings per share after accounting changes   $ 0.71   $ 0.19   $ 0.18                 Potentially dilutive securities, including stock options; restricted stock units; and restricted stock, to purchase approximately 4.4 million, 50.8 million, and 58.0 million shares of common stock for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive.  Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  Segment Information   The Company reports segment information based on the ""management"" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.  72        Note 2Financial Instruments   The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of those instruments.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments   The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's cash and available-for-sale securities held in its short-term investment portfolio, recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments as of September 25, 2004, and September 27, 2003 (in millions):         September 25, 2004   September 27, 2003   Cash   $ 200   $ 158              U.S. Treasury and Agency securities      87      87   U.S. corporate securities     1,795     2,368   Foreign securities     887     783               Total cash equivalents     2,769     3,238             U.S. Treasury and Agency securities     1,080     454   U.S. corporate securities     1,352     623   Foreign securities     63     93                Total short-term investments      2,495      1,170               Total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments   $ 5,464   $ 4,566              The Company's short-term investment portfolio consists of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. The Company's U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses totaling $4 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year as of September 25, 2004 and net unrealized gains of $1 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, as of September 27, 2003. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains before taxes of $1 million in 2004, $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. These net gains were included in interest and other income, net.  As of September 25, 2004, approximately $180 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 25, 2004 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 27, 2003 had maturities of 3 to 12 months.  In accordance with EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, the following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company's  73       investments, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 25, 2004 (in millions):         Less than 12 Months   12 Months or Greater   Total     Security Description   Fair Value   Unrealized Loss   Fair Value   Unrealized Loss   Fair Value   Unrealized Loss     U.S. Treasury and Agencies   $ 1,126   $ (4 ) $    $    $ 1,126   $ (4 )   Corporate bonds     134          144     (1 )   278     (1 )   Certificate of deposits     420     (1 )             420     (1 )   Asset backed securities     426                    426          Commercial paper     2,407     (1 )             2,407     (1 )                           Total   $ 4,513   $ (6 ) $ 144   $ (1 ) $ 4,657   $ (7 )                            Market values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The declines in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the investee, and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.  Accounts Receivable   Trade Receivables   The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. No customer accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 25, 2004. Trade receivables from a single customer, Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.3% of net accounts receivable as of September 27, 2003.  The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in millions):         2004   2003   2002     Beginning allowance balance   $ 49   $ 51   $ 51     Charged to costs and expenses     3     4     10     Deductions (a)     (5 )   (6 )   (10 )                  Ending allowance balance   $ 47   $ 49   $ 51                        (a)Represents amounts written off against the allowance, net of recoveries.   74          Vendor Non-Trade Receivables   The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $276 million and $184 million as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales.  Inventory Prepayment   In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components during the three consecutive fiscal quarters ended December 28, 2002. During the first six months of 2003, the remaining $53 million of the deposit balance was fully utilized for the purchase of components. The deposit was unsecured and had no stated interest component. The Company imputed an amount to cost of sales and interest income during each period the deposit was outstanding at a 3.25% interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction.  Derivative Financial Instruments   The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign currency instruments as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003 (in millions):         September 25, 2004   September 27, 2003       Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Foreign exchange instruments qualifying as accounting hedges:                                         Spot/Forward contracts   $ 598   $ (3 ) $ 3   $ 464   $ (21 ) $      Purchased options   $ 482   $ 4   $ 4   $ 512   $ 3   $ 3     Sold options   $ 521   $ (3 ) $    $ 645   $ (8 ) $     Foreign exchange instruments other than accounting hedges:                                               Spot/Forward contracts   $ 609   $ 3   $ 4   $ 445   $ 3   $ 3     Purchased options   $    $    $    $ 8   $    $      Sold options   $    $    $    $ 5   $    $     The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to  75       potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates.  The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003. In certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.  Foreign Exchange Risk Management   The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and forecasted future cash flows. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 9 months.  Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be dedesignated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are redesignated as hedges of other transactions. During 2004, the Company recorded net losses of $2.8 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003. During 2002, the Company recorded net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $4.4 million, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005.  76       The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.  Interest Rate Risk Management   From time to time, the Company historically entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on any outstanding long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.  In prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on cash equivalents and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its long term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2001 and 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out interest rate debt swap positions realizing gains of $23 million which were deferred over the remaining life of the debt.  As of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding.  Debt   In February 2004, the Company retired $300 million of debt outstanding in the form of 6.5% unsecured notes. The notes were originally issued in 1994 and were sold at 99.9925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. As of September 27, 2003, the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt interest rate swaps, was $304 million, respectively, while the fair value was $302 million. The fair value of the notes was based on their listed market values as of September 27, 2003.  Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses   The Company has held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in other income and expense. In fiscal 2004, the Company sold all of its remaining non-current investments in public companies.  77      EarthLink   In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment was in EarthLink's Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, which was convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Macintosh customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold in the U.S.  During the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Company's carrying value of the shares. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in EarthLink, consisting of 3,960,000 shares of stock for net proceeds of approximately $23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 6.5 million shares of EarthLink stock valued at $35 million.  Akamai   In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. Beginning in the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale.  During 2004, the Company sold its remaining 986,000 shares of Akamai stock. The transaction generated proceeds of approximately $5 million and a gain before taxes of approximately $4 million.  During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $9 million and a gain before taxes of $8 million. As of September 27, 2003, the Company's remaining investment in Akamai consisted of 986,000 shares of Akamai stock valued at $5 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to $3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net.  78        ARM   ARM is a publicly held company in the U.K. involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology.  During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in ARM stock, consisting of 278,000 shares for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of $270,000.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002.  Other Strategic Investments   The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies, which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in other assets. These investments were inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies were typically not fully developed. During 2002, the Company determined the decline in fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of $15 million. These charges were included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had $1.4 million of equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet. As of September 27, 2003, the Company had no private debt or equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet.

The Company ceased amortization of goodwill at the beginning of fiscal 2002 when it adopted SFAS No. 142.  The following table summarizes the components of gross and net intangible asset balances (in millions):         September 25, 2004   September 27, 2003       Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Amount   Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Amount   Goodwill (a)   $ 80        $ 80   $ 85        $ 85   Other acquired intangible assets     5     (5 )        5     (5 )      Acquired technology     42     (25 )   17     42     (18 )   24                         Total acquired intangible assets   $ 127   $ (30 ) $ 97   $ 132   $ (23 ) $ 109                            (a)Accumulated amortization related to goodwill of $55 million arising prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 has been reflected in the gross carrying amount of goodwill as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003.  During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an adjustment of approximately $5 million to goodwill related to the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc (PowerSchool) in fiscal 2001. This reduction of goodwill included the cancellation of 79,167 shares of Apple common stock, valued at approximately $2 million, that were previously held in escrow and were refunded upon resolution of certain matters arising out of the acquisition of PowerSchool. This adjustment also included approximately $3 million to adjust the original estimates of the pre-acquisition PowerSchool restructuring liability to actual costs incurred.  Expected annual amortization expense related to acquired technology is as follows (in millions):     Fiscal Years:           2005   $ 6     2006     3     2007     2     2008     1     2009     1     Thereafter     4          Total expected annual amortization expense   $ 17           Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets is as follows (in millions):         2004   2003   2002   Other acquired intangible assets amortization   $    $    $ 1   Acquired technology amortization     7     10     5                Total amortization   $ 7   $ 10   $ 6                 81      Acquisition of Emagic GmbH   During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH (Emagic), a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately $30 million in cash; $26 million of which was paid immediately upon closing of the deal and $4 million of which was held-back for future payment contingent on continued employment by certain employees that would be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the following 3 years. During fiscal 2003, contingent consideration totaling $1.3 million was paid. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Emagic is not subject to amortization pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible assets acquired   $ 2.3   Acquired technology     3.8   Tradename     0.8   In-process research and development     0.5   Goodwill     18.6            Total consideration   $ 26.0           The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83% complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003, included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%.  Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail   During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of $20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent consideration which would be allocated to compensation expense over the following 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and would be amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that would be amortized over 10 years.  Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC   During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an additional component of  82      the cost of the acquired assets, would be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the following 3 years.  Note 5Restructuring Charges   Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions   The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during the year ended September 25, 2004, including approximately $14 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $23 million charge, $14.3 million had been spent by the end of 2004, with the remaining $8.7 million consisting of $5.2 million for employee severance benefits and $3.5 million for lease cancellations.  During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $5.5 million. In conjunction with the European workforce reduction during the second quarter of 2004, the Company vacated a leased sales facility during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting in a charge of $3.7 million for contract termination and asset impairment costs. The Company also recognized employee termination costs of $1.8 million related to the elimination of non-essential positions, principally in Europe. In addition, the Company reversed $400,000 of excess restructuring expense from prior periods related primarily to lower than expected disposal costs on Sacramento manufacturing-related fixed assets. The net cost of the restructuring plans for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $5.1 million, of which $300,000 had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 54 positions, 4 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2004.  During the third quarter of 2004, the Company finalized restructuring plans related to closing Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento. In addition, the Company's management approved restructuring plans related to certain headcount reductions primarily for various sales and marketing activities principally in the U.S. Total cost of the restructuring plan for the third quarter of 2004 was $7.9 million, of which $7.2 million had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 83 positions, 77 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2004.  The closing of manufacturing operations in Sacramento resulted in the elimination of 67 positions for a severance cost of $1.9 million and write-off of $5.3 million in manufacturing-related fixed assets whose use ceased during the third quarter of 2004. Termination of sales and marketing activities, principally in the U.S., resulted in severance of $0.7 million for the elimination of 16 positions.  During the second quarter of 2004, the Company's management approved restructuring plans related to the termination of Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento and headcount reductions related primarily to various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. Total cost of the actions was $9.6 million for the termination of 348 positions. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, $6.8 million had been spent and 310 positions had been eliminated related to these actions.  83       The following table summarizes activity associated with restructuring actions initiated during fiscal 2004 (in millions):         Employee Severance Benefits   Asset Impairments   Lease Cancellations   Totals     Total charge   $ 14.0   $ 5.5   $ 3.5   $ 23.0     Total spending through September 25, 2004     (8.7 )             (8.7 )   Total non-cash items          (5.2 )        (5.2 )   Adjustments     (0.1 )   (0.3 )        (0.4 )                     Accrual at September 25, 2004   $ 5.2   $    $ 3.5   $ 8.7                        Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions   The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been spent by the end of 2004, except for approximately $3.0 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and a shortfall of approximately $500,000 was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense.  During the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including $2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees.  During the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide.  Closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and marketing activities and employees, principally in the U.S. and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on  84       closed facilities of $6.7 million. The total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.  The following table summarizes activity associated with restructuring actions initiated during fiscal 2003 (in millions):         Employee Severance Benefits   Deferred Compensation Write-off   Asset Impairments   Lease Cancellations   Totals     Total charge   $ 7.4   $ 5.0   $ 7.1   $ 7.3   $ 26.8     Total spending through September 25, 2004     (7.9 )             (3.8 )   (11.7 )   Total non-cash items          (5.0 )   (7.1 )        (12.1 )   Adjustments     0.5               (0.5 )                             Accrual at September 25, 2004   $    $    $    $ 3.0   $ 3.0                           Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions   During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail operating segment.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000. All amounts associated with the fiscal 2002 restructuring actions had been spent by the end of fiscal 2003.  85       Note 6Income Taxes   The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):         2004   2003   2002     Federal:                         Current   $ 34   $ 18   $ 12       Deferred     56     (7 )   (32 )                        90     11     (20 )                  State:                         Current     5     4     3       Deferred     (18 )   (11 )   6                          (13 )   (7 )   9                    Foreign:                         Current     46     21     29       Deferred     (16 )   (1 )   4                          30     20     33                    Provision for income taxes   $ 107   $ 24   $ 22                     The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $384 million, $250 million and $284 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. As of September 25, 2004, approximately $3.2 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company's consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $972 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  86       As of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):         2004   2003   Deferred tax assets:                 Accounts receivable and inventory reserves   $ 32   $ 35     Accrued liabilities and other reserves     195     155     Basis of capital assets and investments     65     47     Tax losses and credits     329     204     Other     26     11               Total deferred tax assets     647     452   Less valuation allowance     30     30             Net deferred tax assets     617     422             Deferred tax liabilities:                 Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries     413     398               Total deferred tax liabilities     413     398             Net deferred tax asset   $ 204   $ 24              As of September 25, 2004, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $446 million, which expire from 2011 through 2024. A portion of these carryforwards was acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $132 million and which expire between 2005 and 2024. The remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.  87        A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2004, 2003, and 2002) to income before provision for income taxes, is as follows (in millions):         2004   2003   2002     Computed expected tax   $ 134   $ 32   $ 30     State taxes, net of federal effect     (5 )   (4 )   7     Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries     (31 )   (13 )        Nondeductible executive compensation     10     5     (1 )   Stock repurchase          (2 )        Purchase accounting and asset acquisitions          4     3     Change in valuation allowance               (16 )   Research and development credit, net     (5 )   (7 )   (8 )   Nondeductible expenses     2     6     4     Other items     2     3     3                    Provision for income taxes   $ 107   $ 24   $ 22                    Effective tax rate     28 %   26 %   25 %    The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2001 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.  Note 7Shareholders' Equity   Restricted Stock Units   During fiscal 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved the grant of 2.515 million restricted stock units to selected members of the Company's senior management, excluding its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). These restricted stock units generally vest in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. The Company has recorded the $64.4 million value of these restricted stock units as a component of shareholders' equity and will amortize that amount on a straight-line basis over the 4 year requisite service period. The value of the restricted stock units was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Quarterly amortization will be approximately $4.0 million, of which approximately $0.5 million will be included in cost of sales; $1.3 million will be included in research and development expense; and the remaining $2.2 million will be included in selling, general and administrative expense. The restricted stock units have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.  CEO Restricted Stock Award   On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Steven P. Jobs, its CEO. The Agreement cancelled stock option  88      awards for the purchase of 27.5 million shares of the Company's common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 60,000 shares of the Company's common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Company's CEO. The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the Company's common stock. The restricted stock award generally vests three years from date of grant. Vesting of some or all of the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in control of the Company.  The Company has recorded the value of the restricted stock award of $74.75 million as a component of shareholders' equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over the 3 year service period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock of $14.95 on the date of the award. Amortization expense for this award, which amounts to approximately $6.2 million per quarter, has been included in selling, general, and administrative expense beginning in March 2003 and will continue to be included through March 2006. The 5 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.  Stock Repurchase Plan   In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.  During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81. Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 25, 2004.  Preferred Stock   The Company has 5 million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding. Under the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.  Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  89      The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes (in millions):         2004   2003   2002     Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities   $ (4 ) $ 1   $ 13     Unrealized losses on derivative investments     (4 )   (16 )   (11 )   Cumulative foreign currency translation     (7 )   (20 )   (51 )                  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   $ (15 ) $ (35 ) $ (49 )                   The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to available-for-sale securities, net of taxes (in millions):         2004   2003   2002     Change in fair value of available-for-sale securities   $ (1 ) $ 11   $ (49 )   Adjustment for net (gains) losses realized and included in net income     (4 )   (23 )   32                    Change in unrealized gain/loss on available-for-sale securities   $ (5 ) $ (12 ) $ (17 )                   The tax effect related to the change in unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities was $4 million, $6 million, and $10 million for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The tax effect on the reclassification adjustment for net gains (losses) included in net income was $1 million, $(8) million and $10 million for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives, net of taxes, held by the Company (in millions):         2004   2003   2002     Changes in fair value of derivatives   $ (21 ) $ (24 ) $ 4     Adjustment for net gains(losses) realized and included in net income     33     19     (19 )                  Change in unrealized gain/loss on derivative instruments   $ 12   $ (5 ) $ (15 )                   The tax effect related to the changes in fair value of derivatives was $10 million, $11million and $(2) million for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The tax effect related to derivative gains (losses) reclassified from other comprehensive income was $(13) million, $(7) million and $8 million for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  Note 8Employee Benefit Plans   2003 Employee Stock Option Plan   At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive officers and other key employees and to prohibit future ""repricings"" of employee stock options, including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with  90      either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.  1997 Employee Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares totaling 14,295,351 following the completion of an employee stock option exchange program in October 2003.  Employee Stock Option Exchange Program   On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company's common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day after the exchange options are cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193 shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Company's stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this transaction.  1997 Director Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant.  Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans   Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, Mr. Bertrand Serlet, and Mr. Avadis Tevanian, Jr., have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of restricted stock units.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan   The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum  91      of $25,000 in any calendar year. Beginning with the six-month offering period that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2004, 2003, and 2002, 2.0 million, 2.1 million, and 1.8 million, respectively were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 25, 2004, approximately 2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.  Employee Savings Plan   The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($13,000 for calendar year 2004). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $24 million, $21 million, and $19 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  Stock Option Activity   A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002 follows (option amounts are presented in thousands):             Outstanding Options       Shares Available for Grant   Number of Shares   Weighted Average Exercise Price   Balance at September 29, 2001   10,075   97,179   $ 29.24     Additional Options Authorized   15,000             Options Granted   (23,239 ) 23,239   $ 19.89     Options Cancelled   4,737   (4,737 ) $ 30.98     Options Exercised      (6,251 ) $ 11.99     Plan Shares Expired   (2 )                         Balance at September 28, 2002   6,571   109,430   $ 28.17     Restricted Stock Granted   (5,000 )           Options Granted   (4,179 ) 4,179   $ 16.38     Options Cancelled   48,443   (48,443 ) $ 39.61     Options Exercised      (2,154 ) $ 14.04     Plan Shares Expired   (5 )                         Balance at September 27, 2003   45,830   63,012   $ 19.08     Restricted Stock Units Granted   (2,515 )           Options Granted   (18,197 ) 18,197   $ 22.97     Options Cancelled   3,005   (3,005 ) $ 20.70     Options Exercised      (22,843 ) $ 17.20     Plan Shares Expired   (16,098 )                         Balance at September 25, 2004   12,025   55,361   $ 21.05                    92        The options outstanding as of September 25, 2004 have been segregated into five ranges for additional disclosure as follows (option amounts are presented in thousands):         Options Outstanding   Options Exercisable       Options Outstanding as of September 25, 2004   Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life in Years   Weighted Average Exercise Price   Options Exercisable as of September 25, 2004   Weighted Average Exercise Price   $0.83-$15.59   6,426   4.65   $ 12.26   4,958   $ 11.59   $15.60-$18.50   15,729   5.87   $ 17.94   12,969   $ 18.04   $18.51-$20.54   9,998   6.91   $ 20.26   5,769   $ 20.25   $20.55-$22.76   15,109   6.23   $ 22.20   1,401   $ 21.77   $22.77-$69.78   8,099   6.24   $ 32.90   4,926   $ 36.46                             $0.83-$69.78   55,361   6.07   $ 21.05   30,023   $ 20.59                              As of September 27, 2003, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 38.8 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $18.75 per share. As of September 28, 2002, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 57.9 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $30.85 per share.  The Company had 2.515 million restricted stock units outstanding as of September 25, 2004, which were excluded from the options outstanding balances in the preceding tables. None of these restricted stock units were vested as of September 25, 2004. The grant of these restricted stock units has been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company's stock option plans.  Note 9Stock-Based Compensation   The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Employee Stock Option Exchange Program have been accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees. The cancellation of certain of the Company's CEO's options and replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.  93       The assumptions used for each of the last three fiscal years and the resulting estimate of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those years are as follows:         2004   2003   2002     Expected life of stock options     3.5 years     3.5-4 years     4 years     Expected life of stock purchases     6 months     6 months     6 months     Interest ratestock options     2.33%-3.15 %   2.14%-2.45 %   2.90 %   Interest ratestock purchases     0.96%-1.67 %   1.10%-1.77 %   2.71 %   Volatilitystock options     40 %   40%-63 %   64 %   Volatilitystock purchases     32%-44 %   35%-44 %   51 %   Dividend yields                     Weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year   $  7.37   $  6.63   $  10.11     Weighted-average fair value of stock purchases during the year   $ 5.56   $ 4.24   $ 6.73      For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company prior to the third quarter of 2003 had been based solely on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, the Company has modified this approach to consider other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock and the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company will continue to monitor these and other relevant factors in developing the expected volatility assumption used to value future awards.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, the Company shortened its estimate of the expected life of new options granted to its employees from 4 years to 3.5 years. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees. The change in the expected life assumption made during the third quarter of 2003 was the result of the expected impact of shortening the contractual life of new options granted to employees from 10 years to 7 years and changing the vesting provisions of new options granted to employees from 4 year straight-line annual vesting to 4 year straight-line quarterly vesting.  Note 10Commitments and Contingencies   Lease Commitments   The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 16 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 25, 2004, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $617 million, of which $436 million related to leases for retail space.  Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $103 million, $97 million, and $92 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Future minimum lease  94       payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 25, 2004, are as follows (in millions):     Fiscal Years           2005   $  89   2006     91   2007     79   2008     65   2009     61   Later years     232          Total minimum lease payments   $ 617           Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications   The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future expectations.  The following table reconciles changes in the Company's accrued warranties and related costs (in millions):         2004   2003   2002     Beginning accrued warranty and related costs   $ 67   $ 69   $ 87     Cost of warranty claims     (105 )   (71 )   (79 )   Accruals for product warranties     143     69     61                    Ending accrued warranty and related costs   $ 105   $ 67   $ 69                     The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 25, 2004 or September 27, 2003.  95       Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product   Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits, or (""ASICs"")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the majority of which occurs in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations.  Contingencies   Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard the Company's motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiffs' claims with prejudice on August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling.  The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers  96       the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.  Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data   In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company reports segment information based on the ""management"" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.  The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan and excludes revenue from the Company's own retail stores in Japan, which is included in the Company's Retail segment. The Retail segment operated Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and Japan during fiscal 2004. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" except as described below for the Retail segment.  The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segment's performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $104 million, $92 million and $106 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Operating income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. This measure of operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable basis for comparison between the Company's various geographic segments. Certain manufacturing expenses and  97       related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses.  Management assesses the operating performance of the Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the Company's geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income is intended to depict a comparable measure to that of the Company's major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can evaluate the Retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner. Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results of the Company's other segments.  First, the Retail segment's operating income includes cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Company's cost to support those partners. For the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $213 million, $106 million, and $52 million, respectively.  Second, the Company's extended warranty, support and service contracts are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the Company's major retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a comparable measure of revenue and gross margin between the Company's Retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes the full amount of revenue and cost of sales at the time of sale of the Company's extended warranty, support and service contracts. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments' net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 25, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $54 million and $37 million, respectively. For the year ended September 27, 2003, the net sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of extended warranty, support and service contracts were $30 million and $20 million, respectively. For the year ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment of $8 million and $6 million, respectively.  Third, the Company has opened six high profile stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan and Osaka, Japan as of September 25, 2004 and has an additional store under development in London, England, which is expected to open by the end of calendar year 2004. These high profile stores are larger than the Company's typical retail stores and were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The allocation of these operating costs is based on the excess amount incurred for a high profile store to that of a more typical Company retail location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these stores were $16 million, $6 million and $1 million for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002 respectively.  98       Summary information by operating segment follows (in millions):         2004   2003   2002     Americas:                         Net sales   $ 4,019   $ 3,181   $ 3,131       Operating income   $ 465   $ 323   $ 278       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 6   $ 5   $ 4       Segment assets (a)   $ 563   $ 494   $ 395      Europe:                            Net sales   $ 1,799   $ 1,309   $ 1,251       Operating income   $ 280   $ 130   $ 122       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 4   $ 4   $ 4       Segment assets   $ 259   $ 252   $ 165      Japan:                            Net sales   $ 677   $ 698   $ 710       Operating income   $ 115   $ 121   $ 140       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 2   $ 3   $ 2       Segment assets   $ 114   $ 130   $ 50      Retail:                            Net sales   $ 1,185   $ 621   $ 283       Operating income (loss)   $ 39   $ (5 ) $ (22 )     Depreciation, amortization and accretion (b)   $ 35   $ 25   $ 16       Segment assets (b)   $ 351   $ 243   $ 141      Other Segments (c):                            Net sales   $ 599   $ 398   $ 367       Operating income   $ 90   $ 51   $ 44       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 2   $ 2   $ 2       Segment assets   $ 124   $ 78   $ 67         (a)The Americas asset figures do not include fixed assets held in the U.S. Such fixed assets are not allocated specifically to the Americas segment and are included in the corporate assets figures below.

Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the U.S., and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals, currency exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2004, 2003 or 2002.  Net sales and long-lived assets related to operations in the U.S., Japan, and other foreign countries are as follows (in millions):         2004   2003   2002   Net Sales:                     U.S.   $ 4,893   $ 3,627   $ 3,272   Japan     738     698     710   Other Countries     2,648     1,882     1,760                  Total Net Sales   $ 8,279   $ 6,207   $ 5,742                 Long-Lived Assets:                        U.S.   $ 637   $ 635   $ 561   Japan     52     19     2   Other Countries     72     60     69                  Total Long-Lived Assets   $ 761   $ 714   $ 632                 100      Information regarding net sales by product is as follows (in millions):         2004   2003   2002   Net Sales:                     Power Macintosh (a)   $ 1,419   $ 1,237   $ 1,380   PowerBook     1,589     1,299     831   iMac (b)     954     1,238     1,448   iBook     961     717     875                  Total Macintosh Net Sales   $ 4,923   $ 4,491   $ 4,534    iPod      1,306      345      143   Other Music Products (c)     278     36     4   Peripherals and other hardware (d)     951     691     527   Software (e)     502     362     307   Service and other Net Sales     319     282     227                  Total Net Sales   $ 8,279   $ 6,207   $ 5,742                    (a)Includes Xserve product line.

Note 12Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions   In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement became effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $483,000, $404,000, and $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.  In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company in May 2000 loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his principal residence. The loan was secured by a deed of trust and was due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid $750,000 of this loan in fiscal 2003 and repaid the remaining balance of $750,000 in fiscal 2004.  Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. Until September 7, 2003, he also served as Microwarehouse's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse was a reseller of computer hardware, software and peripheral products, including products made by the  101       Company. On September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW), acquired selected North American assets of MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. MicroWarehouse accounted for approximately 0.3%, 2.4% and 3.3% of the Company's net sales for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $4.3 million and $9.9 million as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, respectively. The Company has provided what it believes to be an adequate allowance on the outstanding receivable based on the Company's secured interest position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected payments to unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables were generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those with the Company's other resellers. In addition, the Company has purchased miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases amounted to approximately $2.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, respectively. No purchases were made by the Company from MicroWarehouse in fiscal 2004.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 25, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in 2003 and changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002.         /s/  KPMG LLP          Mountain View, California October 12, 2004  103             Item 9.

Controls and Procedures      Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) were effective as of September 25, 2004 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  There were no significant changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  104          PART III          Item 10.

Role of the Board; Corporate Governance Matters   It is the paramount duty of the Board of Directors to oversee the Chief Executive Officer and other senior management in the competent and ethical operation of the Company on a day-to-day basis and to assure that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being served. To satisfy this duty, the directors take a proactive, focused approach to their position, and set standards to ensure that the Company is committed to business success through maintenance of the highest standards of responsibility and ethics.  Members of the Board bring to the Company a wide range of experience, knowledge and judgment. These varied skills mean that good governance depends on far more than a ""check the box"" approach to standards or procedures. The governance structure in the Company is designed to be a working structure for principled actions, effective decision-making and appropriate monitoring of both compliance and performance. The key practices and procedures of the Board are outlined in the Corporate Governance Guidelines available on the Company's website at www.apple.com/investor.

In March 2003, Mr. Jobs voluntarily cancelled all of his outstanding options, excluding those granted to him in his capacity as a director.  Director Compensation   The form and amount of director compensation is determined by the Board after a review of recommendations made by the Nominating Committee. The current practice of the Board is to base a substantial portion of a director's annual retainer on equity. In 1998, shareholders approved the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan (the ""Director Plan"") and 800,000 shares were reserved for issuance thereunder. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Company's non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of Common Stock upon their initial election to the Board (""Initial Options""). The Initial Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee director's initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock (""Annual Options""). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. As of the end of the fiscal year, there were options for 440,000 shares outstanding under the Director Plan. Since accepting the position of CEO, Mr. Jobs is no longer eligible for grants under the Director Plan. Non-employee directors also receive a $50,000 annual retainer paid in quarterly increments. In addition, directors receive up to two free computer systems per year and are eligible to purchase additional equipment at a discount. Directors do not receive any additional consideration for serving on committees or as committee chairperson.  Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation   The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. William V. Campbell, Millard S. Drexler, and Albert Gore, Jr., none of whom are employees of the Company and all of whom are considered ""independent"" directors under the applicable NASDAQ rules. No person who was an employee of the Company in fiscal year 2004 served on the Compensation Committee. No executive officer of the Company (i) served as a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee, (ii) served as a  109      director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee, or (iii) served as a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of the Company.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance   Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders also are required by rules promulgated by the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

Arrangements with Named Executive Officers   Change In Control ArrangementsStock Options, Restricted Stock, and Restricted Stock Units   In the event of a ""change in control"" of the Company, all outstanding options under the Company's stock option plans, except the Director Plan, will, unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator, become exercisable in full, and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable ""change in control price"" and the exercise price. The Director Plan provides that upon a ""change in control"" of the Company, all unvested options held by non-employee directors will automatically become fully vested and exercisable and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable ""change in control price"" and the exercise price of the options. A ""change in control"" under these plans is generally defined as (i) the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities or (ii) the occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.  In addition, options, restricted stock grants, and restricted stock units granted to the Named Executive Officers generally provide that in the event there is a ""change in control,"" as defined in the Company's stock option plans, and if in connection with or following such ""change in control,"" their employment is terminated without ""Cause"" or if they should resign for ""Good Reason,"" those options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units outstanding that are not yet vested as of the date of such ""change in control"" shall become fully vested. Further, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to the Named Executive Officers also provide that, in the event the Company terminates the Officer without cause at any time, the restricted stock units and restricted stock will vest in full. Generally, ""Cause"" is defined to include a felony conviction, willful disclosure of confidential information or willful and continued failure to perform his or her employment duties. ""Good Reason"" includes resignation of employment as a result of a substantial diminution in position or duties, or an adverse change in title or reduction in annual base salary.      Item 13.

Mr. Johnson repaid the Company $750,000 during the fiscal year and the loan has been repaid in full.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Performed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   Prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the ""Act""), the Company adopted an auditor independence policy that banned its auditors from performing non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This auditor policy also mandates that the audit and non-audit services and the related budget be approved by the Audit Committee in advance, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that no auditor engagements for non-audit services may be entered into without the express approval of the Audit Committee.  113             PART IV          Item 15.

"Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading ""Business.""  The Company believes that for both professionals and consumers the personal computer has become the center of an evolving digital lifestyle by integrating with and enhancing the utility of advanced digital devices such as the Company's iPods, iPhones, digital video and still cameras, televisions, personal digital assistants, and other digital devices. The attributes of the personal computer that enable this functionality include a high-quality user interface, easy access to relatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications, and the ability to connect easily to a wide variety of other digital devices and to the Internet. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire personal computerfrom the hardware and operating system to sophisticated applications. This, along with its products' creative industrial designs, intuitive ease-of-use, and built-in graphics, multimedia and networking capabilities, uniquely positions the Company to offer innovative integrated digital lifestyle solutions.  The Company's business strategy leverages its ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design.  The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of computers, consumer electronics with its iPod product family of portable digital music players, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. With the introduction of iPhone, the Company has also begun to compete with mobile communication device companies that have substantial experience and technological and financial resources. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly competitive and subject to  36       aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development (""R&D"") and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Company's R&D spending is focused on further developing its existing line of personal computers, operating systems, application software, and portable digital music players; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas such as iPhone and wireless technologies. The Company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.  The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Mac computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 197 stores open as of September 29, 2007.  The Company also staffs selected third-party stores with the Company's own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees and contractors in reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, Asia, Latin America and Australia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world.  To improve access to the iPod product family, the Company has significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold. iPods can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above.  The Company began shipping iPhone in the U.S. on June 29, 2007, in the U.K. and Germany on November 9, 2007 and expects to begin shipping the iPhone in France on November 29, 2007. AT&T Mobility LLC (""AT&T""), O2 Limited (""O2""), T-Mobile International AG & Co. KG (""T-Mobile""), and France Telecom (""Orange"") are the exclusive cellular network carriers for iPhone in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and France, respectively. iPhone is distributed through the Company and its exclusive cellular network carriers' distribution channels.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.  Management believes the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these critical policies because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments  37       and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition   Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (""EITF"") No. 03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software, (e.g., Mac computers, iPod portable digital music players and iPhone) pursuant to American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (""AICPA"") Statement of Position (""SOP"") No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. For products that are not software or software-related, (e.g., digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories) the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (""SAB"") No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.  During 2007, the Company began shipping Apple TV and iPhone. For both Apple TV and iPhone, the Company indicated it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Therefore, sales of Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. The Company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred.  The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. If refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company  38       would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debt, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments were made.  Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments   The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were recorded.  The Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.  39         Warranty Costs   The Company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company's results of operations.  The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the software's compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.  Stock-Based Compensation   The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (""SFAS"") No. 123 (revised 2004) (""SFAS No. 123R""), Share-Based Payment. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (""BSM"") option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.  Income Taxes   The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.  Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Legal and Other Contingencies   As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading ""Legal Proceedings"" and in Note 8 ""Commitments and Contingencies"" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is  40      subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In management's opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  41      Net Sales   Fiscal years 2007 and 2005 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks.

NM = Not Meaningful  42      Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006   Net sales during 2007 increased 24% or $4.7 billion from 2006 even though the fiscal year of 2007 spanned 52 weeks while the fiscal year of 2006 spanned 53 weeks. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following:    Mac net sales increased $3 billion or 40% during 2007 compared to 2006, while Mac unit sales increased by 1.75 million units or 33%. The 33% Mac unit sales growth rate is significantly greater than the estimated growth rate of the overall personal computer industry during that timeframe. Unit sales of the Company's portable products accounted for 62% of the Company's personal computer shipments in 2007, up from 54% in 2006. Net sales and unit sales of the Company's portable products increased 55% and 51%, respectively, during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was due to strong demand for the MacBook, which increased in each of the Company's operating segments, as well as the MacBook Pro, which increased in each operating segment except Japan. Mac desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 21% and 12%, respectively, during 2007 due to stronger sales of the iMac in each of the Company's operating segments. The Mac desktop net sales growth was greater than the unit sales growth primarily due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the lower-price Mac Mini and discontinued eMac and toward the iMac. Net sales of iPods increased $629 million or 8% during 2007 compared to 2006. Unit sales of iPods increased 31% compared to 2006. The iPod growth was primarily driven by increased sales of the iPod shuffle and iPod nano particularly in international markets. iPod unit sales growth was significantly greater than iPod net sales due to a shift in overall iPod product mix, as well as due to lower selling prices for the iPod classic, iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2007 compared to 2006. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007. iPhone net sales include the portion of iPhone handset revenue recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over the product's 24-month estimated economic life, as well as sales of iPhone accessory products and revenue from carrier agreements. iPhone unit sales were 1.39 million in 2007. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $611 million or 32% during 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store. The Company believes this growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. Net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $160 million or 15% compared to 2006 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware accessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays. Net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $229 million or 18% during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales of AppleCare Protection Plan (""APP"") extended service and support contracts and increased sales of Apple branded and third-party developers' software products.   Fiscal Year 2006 versus 2005   Net sales during 2006 increased 39% or $5.4 billion from 2005. This increase was due in part to the fact that 2006 spanned 53 weeks while 2005 spanned 52 weeks. Several other factors contributed to these increases including the following:    Net sales of iPods increased $3.1 billion or 69% during 2006 compared to 2005. Unit sales of iPods totaled 39.4 million in 2006, which represents an increase of 75% from the 22.5 million iPod units sold in 2005. Strong iPod sales during 2006 reflected significant sales of both the hard-drive based iPod that supports video, first introduced in October of 2005 and the iPod nano, introduced in September 2005, as well as continued expansion of iPod distribution points. During 2006, the net   43        sales per iPod unit sold decreased by 3% compared to 2005 primarily due to an overall decrease in average selling prices for all iPods as well as a shift in product mix to the iPod nano.    Mac net sales increased $1.1 billion or 18% during 2006 compared to 2005. Mac unit sales increased by 769,000 units or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were mainly due to strong demand for the Intel-based MacBook and MacBook Pro systems and reflect a shift in product mix to portable products in all of the Company's operating segments. Net sales and unit sales of the Company's portable products increased 43% and 42%, respectively, during 2006 compared to 2005. Mac desktop net sales and unit sales both decreased by 3% during 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in sales of the Company's Mac desktops was due to declines in sales of the Company's professional-oriented desktop products. The Company believes the decline in the Company's professional-oriented desktop products was due to customers delaying purchases of such products in anticipation of the release of the Intel-based Mac Pro, which did not begin shipping until August 2006, and updated software applications capable of running on Intel-based Mac computers, and the trend toward portable computers. A slight increase of 1% during 2006 in net sales per Mac unit sold was due to a shift in mix to higher-priced portable products, partially offset by price reductions on certain Mac systems. Other music related products and services consists of sales associated with the iTunes Store and iPod services and accessories. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $986 million or 110% during 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store and Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and services. The increase in sales from the iTunes Store stemmed from significant growth in U.S. sales and the opening of the iTunes Store in Japan during August 2005 and Australia during October 2005. The increased sales from the iTunes Store were also attributable to the availability of videos, television shows, and feature-length movie downloads. Net sales of software, service, and other sales increased $188 million or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. The growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales of AppleCare Protection Plan (""APP"") extended service and support contracts and application software, partially offset by a decrease in sales of Mac OS X. Mac OS X sales were particularly high in 2005 due to the release of Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005.   Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales during 2006 were negatively impacted by the following:    Net sales of peripherals and other hardware declined $26 million or 2% compared to 2005 primarily due to price decreases and a decrease in net sales of displays relating to a shift in mix from desktop to portable systems. The decrease in net sales of displays for 2006 is consistent with the overall decrease in unit sales of Mac professional desktop systems.    Segment Operating Performance   The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K. and Italy. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the Retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services. During 2007, the Company revised the way it measures the Retail Segment's operating results to a manner that is generally consistent with the Company's other operating segments. Prior period results have been reclassified to reflect this change to the Retail Segment's operating results along with the corresponding offsets to the other operating segments. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Note 9,  44      ""Segment Information and Geographic Data"" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.  Americas   During 2007, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, compared to 2006. The main sources of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of the MacBook, introduced in May 2006 and updated in May 2007, as well as the MacBook Pro, introduced in January 2006 and updated in June 2007. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle and the introduction of the iPod touch in September 2007. The Company believes that the growth in iTunes Store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. During 2007, the Americas segment represented 48% of the Company's total net sales as compared to 49% in the same period of 2006. During 2007, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales increased by 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to 2006. Net sales from the higher education market grew 17% during 2007 compared to 2006, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 10% during the same period.  During 2006, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.8 billion, or 41%, compared to 2005. The primary contributors to this increase were iPods, other music related products and services, Mac portable systems, and APP. Sales of iPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video-playing capabilities in October 2005 (now referred to as iPod classic) and the iPod nano during September 2005. The increase in other music related products and services was due to increases in sales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and sales from the iTunes Store. The increase in sales of Mac portable systems in the Americas was due to strong sales of the MacBook and MacBook Pro during 2006. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in net sales of desktops, displays, and Mac OS X. The decrease in desktop products and displays net sales reflects the overall shift in product mix toward portable Mac systems. Mac OS X sales decreased from 2005 since the Company had not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping in April 2005. During 2006, the Americas segment represented 49% of the Company's total net sales as compared to 48% in the same period of 2005.  Europe   Europe segment net sales increased $1.4 billion or 33% during 2007 compared to 2006. Consistent with the Americas segment, the primary drivers of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of both the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew primarily due to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle. The Company believes that the growth in iTunes Store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store.  Europe segment net sales increased $1.0 billion or 33% during 2006 compared to 2005. Consistent with the Americas segment, these increases were a result of strong growth in iPod sales, other music related products and services, and Mac portable systems. Sales of iPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video-playing capabilities in October 2005 and the iPod nano during September 2005. The increase in other music related products and services was due to increases in sales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and sales from the iTunes Store. The increase in sales of portable systems in Europe was due to strong sales of the MacBook and MacBook Pro that were introduced during 2006. In addition, Europe also reported increased sales in APP related to the increase in Mac unit sales. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in desktop and Mac OS X net sales  45       during 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in desktop net sales was due to the shift in product mix toward portable Mac systems. Mac OS X sales have decreased from 2005 since the Company has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping in April 2005.  Japan   Japan's net sales declined by $129 million or 11% in 2007 compared to 2006. Total Mac unit sales in Japan declined 1% during 2007. The decrease in the Japan segment's overall net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in iPod and Mac desktop sales, partially offset by an increase in revenue from MacBooks and sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. The decline in net sales and Mac unit sales is partially attributable to Japan's declining consumer PC market, and the iPod sales decline is primarily due to lower average selling prices. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve the future results of its Japan segment.  Japan's net sales increased $287 million or 31% during 2006 compared to 2005. The Japan segment experienced increased net sales in iPods, Mac portable products, and other music related products and services. Consistent with the Company's other segments, Japan experienced increases in sales of iPods due to the introduction of the iPod with video-playing capabilities (now referred to as the iPod classic) and the iPod nano in October and September of 2005, respectively. Japan also experienced strong sales of the Intel-based MacBook and increased sales from the iTunes Store. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Mac desktop products, displays, and Mac OS X. The decreases in desktop products and displays reflect the overall shift in product mix toward portable Mac systems. Mac OS X sales have decreased from 2005 since the Company had not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping in April 2005. Total Mac unit sales during 2006 remained relatively flat compared to 2005.  Retail   The Company opened 32 new retail stores during 2007, including a total of 5 international stores in the U.K. and Italy, bringing the total number of open stores to 197 as of September 29, 2007. This compares to 165 open stores as of September 30, 2006 and 124 open stores as of September 24, 2005.  The Retail segment's net sales increased by 27% to $4.1 billion during 2007 compared to 2006. Retail segment Mac unit sales increased 56% during 2007 as compared to 2006. With an average of 178 stores open during 2007, average revenue per store was $23.1 million, compared to $22.9 million in 2006 and $21.7 million in 2005. The current year increase in Retail segment net sales was primarily due to stronger sales of Mac portable products, iMacs, accessories and services. The increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of iPods and other music related products due to the expanded availability of those products through third-party resellers.  The Retail segment's net sales increased by 42% to $3.3 billion during 2006 compared to 2005. Retail segment Mac unit sales increased 45% during 2006 compared to 2005. The current year increase was primarily due to strong sales of Mac portable and desktop products, iPods, and other music related products and services. Sales of iPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video-playing capabilities in October 2005 and the iPod nano during September 2005. The increase in other music related products and services was due to increased sales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories. Mac portable and desktop sales increased due to strong sales of the Intel-based MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac.  As measured by the Company's operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $875 million during 2007 as compared to operating income of $600 million and $396 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. This improvement in 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in the Company's overall gross margin percentage.  Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses.  46      Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $294 million in 2007, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the Retail segment to $1.0 billion. As of September 29, 2007, the Retail segment had approximately 7,900 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $1.1 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Other Segments   The Company's Other Segments, which consists of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $406 million, or 30% during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase related primarily to a 58% increase in sales of Mac portable products and strong iPod sales in the Company's Asia Pacific region.  During 2006, net sales in Other Segments increased 35% compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in sales of iPod and Mac portable products. Strong sales growth was a result of the introduction of the updated iPods featuring video-playing capabilities and the new Intel-based Mac portable products that translated to a 16% increase in Mac unit sales during 2006 compared to 2005.  Gross Margin   Gross margin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):         September 29, 2007   September 30, 2006   September 24, 2005     Net sales   $ 24,006   $ 19,315   $ 13,931     Cost of sales     15,852     13,717     9,889                    Gross margin   $ 8,154   $ 5,598   $ 4,042                    Gross margin percentage     34.0 %   29.0 %   29.0 %    Gross margin percentage of 34.0% in 2007 increased significantly from 29.0% in 2006. The primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components, including NAND flash memory and DRAM memory, higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the Company's direct sales channels.  The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margins of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries will be subject to pressure due to price competition. The Company expects gross margin percentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of the full-quarter impact of product transitions and reduced pricing that were effected in the fourth quarter of 2007, lower sales of iLife and iWork in their second quarter of availability, seasonally higher component costs, and a higher mix of indirect sales. These factors are expected to be partially offset by higher sales of the Company's Mac OS X operating system due to the introduction of Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard (""Mac OS X Leopard"") that became available in October 2007.  The foregoing statements regarding the Company's expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and a potential shift in the Company's sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate  47       demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company's significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.  The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Company's financial condition and operating results in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  Gross margin percentage of 29.0% in 2006 remained flat compared to 2005. The Company experienced more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including LCD flat-panel displays and DRAM memory and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs, offset by an increase in lower margin iPod sales and other music-related services.  Operating Expenses   Operating expenses for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except for percentages):         September 29, 2007   September 30, 2006   September 24, 2005     Research and development   $ 782   $ 712   $ 535       Percentage of net sales     3 %   4 %   4 %   Selling, general, and administrative expenses   $ 2,963   $ 2,433   $ 1,864       Percentage of net sales     12 %   13 %   13 %    Research and Development (""R&D"")   Expenditures for R&D increased 10% or $70 million to $782 million in 2007 compared to 2006. R&D expense does not include capitalized software development costs of $75 million related to the development of Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone. The increases in R&D expense were primarily due to an increase in R&D headcount in the current year to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development costs mentioned above. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to increase spending in R&D to remain competitive.  Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (""SG&A"")   Expenditures for SG&A increased $530 million or 22% during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales in 2007, the Company's continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, and a current year increase in spending on marketing and advertising, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007.  48      Other Income and Expense   Other income and expense for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions):         September 29, 2007   September 30, 2006   September 24, 2005     Interest income   $ 647   $ 394   $ 183     Other income (expense), net     (48 )   (29 )   (18 )                  Total other income and expense   $ 599   $ 365   $ 165                     Total other income and expense increased $234 million or 64% to $599 million during 2007 as compared to $365 million and $165 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 is attributable primarily to increased interest received from higher cash and short-term investment balances and stronger investment yields resulting from higher average market interest rates partially offset by one less week of interest income earned in 2007. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to 5.27% in 2007 as compared to the 4.58% and 2.70% rates earned during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The current year increase in interest income was partially offset by higher other expense, which was primarily associated with higher foreign currency hedging expenses. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any interest expense.  Provision for Income Taxes   The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended September 29, 2007 was 30%. The Company's effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. In addition, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $63 million due to the settlement of prior year audits in the U.S.  As of September 29, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $1.1 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. As of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006 a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.  The Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company intends to contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (""SFAS No. 159""). SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to elect measuring eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. SFAS  49      No. 159 requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 159, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results.  In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 157, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results.  In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (""FIN"") 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a framework for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions that they have taken or expect to take in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FIN 48, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results.  Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions):         September 29, 2007   September 30, 2006   September 24, 2005   Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments   $ 15,386   $ 10,110   $ 8,261   Accounts receivable, net   $ 1,637   $ 1,252   $ 895   Inventory   $ 346   $ 270   $ 165   Working capital   $ 12,657   $ 8,066   $ 6,813   Annual operating cash flow   $ 5,470   $ 2,220   $ 2,535    As of September 29, 2007, the Company had $15.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $5.3 billion over the same balance at the end of September 30, 2006. The principal components of this net increase were cash generated by operating activities of $5.5 billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $365 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $377 million. These increases were partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment of $735 million and payments for acquisitions of intangible assets of $251 million. The Company's short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated, liquid investments. As of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, $6.5 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.  The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.  50       Capital Assets   The Company's total capital asset purchases were $822 million during 2007, consisting of $294 million for retail store facilities and $528 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. Of the $822 million in total capital asset purchases during 2007, $87 million were not yet paid for as of September 29, 2007. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $1.1 billion for capital asset purchases during 2008, including approximately $400 million for expansion of the Company's Retail segment, and approximately $700 million to support normal replacement of existing capital assets, including manufacturing related equipment, enhancements to general information technology infrastructure, and real estate acquisitions.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company.  The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 29, 2007 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Company's balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions):         Total   Payments Due in Less Than 1 Year   Payments Due in 1-3 Years   Payments Due in 4-5 Years   Payments Due in More Than 5 Years   Operating leases   $ 1,425   $ 155   $ 345   $ 308   $ 617   Purchase obligations     3,179     3,179                  Asset retirement obligations     24     3     3     7     11   Other obligations     50     50                                     Total   $ 4,678   $ 3,387   $ 348   $ 315   $ 628                       Lease Commitments   As of September 29, 2007, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Lease terms on the Company's existing major facility operating leases generally range from 3 to 15 years.  Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers   The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2 whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of September 29, 2007, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component purchase commitments, and warranty commitments of $3.2 billion.  During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these  51       agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $208 million of the prepayment as of September 29, 2007.  Asset Retirement Obligations   The Company's asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 29, 2007, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $24 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.  Other Obligations   Other outstanding obligations were $50 million as of September 29, 2007, primarily related to Internet and telecommunications services and the estimated cost related to the $100 store credit the Company offered to customers who purchased an iPhone prior to the Company's September 2007 price reduction.  Indemnifications   The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management   The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Interest Rate Risk   While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, the value of those investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  The Company's short-term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. A portion of the Company's cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company's investment policy and to an objective market benchmark. The Company's internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs.  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by highly rated issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's  52       general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. As of September 29, 2007, $1.9 billion of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized net gains before taxes on short-term investments of approximately $474,000 in 2007 and net losses before taxes of approximately $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively.  To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 29, 2007, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in $16 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 30, 2006, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $15 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.  Foreign Currency Risk   In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and/or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (""VAR"") model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3,000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $12.8 million as of September 29, 2007 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $9.2 million as of September 30, 2006. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.  Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company's investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 29, 2007 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company's actual exposures and positions.  53             Item 8.

     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively ""Apple"" or the ""Company"") design, manufacture, and market personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers.  Basis of Presentation and Preparation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  The Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2007 contained 13 weeks and the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 contained 14 weeks. The Company's fiscal year 2007 ended on September 29, 2007 and included 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2006 included 53 weeks and fiscal year 2005 included 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.  Financial Instruments   Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments   All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.  Derivative Financial Instruments   The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (""SFAS"") No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, must be adjusted to fair value through earnings.  For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects  59       earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings.  Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Company's inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.  Property, Plant, and Equipment   Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $249 million, $180 million, and $141 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  Asset Retirement Obligations   The Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the Company's existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company's asset retirement liability was $18 million and $15 million as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively.  Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets   The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  60       Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any material impairments during 2007, 2006, and 2005.  SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests on or about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2007, 2006, or 2005. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.  SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 2 to 10 years.  Foreign Currency Translation   The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in ""accumulated other comprehensive income"" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations.  Revenue Recognition   Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. For any product within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (""EITF"") No. 03-5,  Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software (e.g., Macintosh computers and iPod portable digital music players), the Company accounts for such products in accordance with the revenue recognition provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (""AICPA"") Statement of Position (""SOP"") No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The Company applies Staff Accounting Bulletin (""SAB"") No. 104, Revenue Recognition, for products that are not software or software-related, such as digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories.  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For  61       most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable.  Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Company's one-year limited warranty.  The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.  The Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. If a multiple-element arrangement includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the Company applies EITF No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the SOP No. 97-2 deliverables. If the Company can separate the deliverables, the Company applies SOP No. 97-2 to the software and software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance (e.g., SAB No. 104) to the deliverables outside the scope of SOP No. 97-2. Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element. Each element's allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence (""VSOE""), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.  The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.  Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade  62       right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.  In March 2007, the Company began shipping Apple TV and in June 2007 began shipping iPhone. For Apple TV and iPhone, the Company indicated it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, Apple TV and iPhone handsets sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. As such, the Company's policy is to defer the associated revenue and cost of goods sold at the time of sale, and recognize both on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company's customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers' ability to pay.  Shipping Costs   For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.  Warranty Expense   The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.  Software Development Costs   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86,  Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed.  In 2007, the Company determined that both Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard (""Mac OS X Leopard"") and iPhone achieved technological feasibility. During 2007, the Company capitalized $75 million of costs associated with the development of Leopard and iPhone. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, the capitalized costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone are amortized to cost of sales commencing when each respective product begins shipping and are recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.  63       Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $13 million, $18 million, and $16 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  Advertising Costs   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $467 million, $338 million, and $287 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation   On September 25, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (""SFAS No. 123R""), Share-Based Payment, which addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. In January 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for stock-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board (""APB"") Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and instead generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (""BSM"") option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that used for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.  SFAS No. 123R prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. The Company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit, and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25. The Company applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, as if the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was recognized.  64       The following table illustrates the effect on net income after taxes and net income per common share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation during 2005 (in millions, except per share amounts):         2005     Net income   $ 1,328      Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of tax      45     Deduct: Stock-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards, net of tax     (118 )            Net incomepro forma   $ 1,255              Net income per common share             Basic   $ 1.64       Diluted   $ 1.55      Net income per common sharepro forma              Basic   $ 1.55       Diluted   $ 1.47      Further information regarding stock-based compensation can be found in Notes 6 and 7.  Earnings Per Common Share   Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (""RSUs"") is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock, and RSUs. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and RSUs can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.  65      The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):     Three fiscal years ended September 29, 2007    2007   2006   2005   Numerator (in millions):                     Net income   $ 3,496   $ 1,989   $ 1,328                Denominator (in thousands):                       Weighted-average shares outstanding, excluding unvested restricted stock     864,595     844,058     808,439     Effect of dilutive securities     24,697     33,468     48,439                  Denominator for diluted earnings per share     889,292     877,526     856,878                Basic earnings per share   $ 4.04   $ 2.36   $ 1.64    Diluted earnings per share   $  3.93   $  2.27   $  1.55    Potentially dilutive securities representing 13.7 million, 3.9 million, and 12.7 million shares of common stock for the years ended September 29, 2007, September 30, 2006, and September 24, 2005, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. These potentially dilutive securities include stock options, unvested restricted stock, and RSUs.  Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  Segment Information   The Company reports segment information based on the ""management"" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.  66        Note 2Financial Instruments   Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments   The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's cash and available-for-sale securities held in its short-term investment portfolio, recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments (in millions):         September 29, 2007   September 30, 2006   Cash   $ 256   $ 200             U.S. Treasury and Agency securities     670     52   U.S. Corporate securities     5,597     4,309   Foreign securities     2,829     1,831               Total cash equivalents     9,096     6,192             U.S. Treasury and Agency securities     358     447   U.S. Corporate securities     4,718     2,701   Foreign securities     958     570               Total short-term investments     6,034     3,718               Total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments   $ 15,386   $ 10,110              The Company's U.S. Corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper issued by foreign companies, and certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had $11 million in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years, as of September 29, 2007, and net unrealized losses of approximately $687,000 on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year, as of September 30, 2006. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized net gains before taxes of approximately $474,000 in 2007 and net losses before taxes of approximately $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively.  As of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, $1.9 billion and $921 million, respectively, of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006 had maturities less than 12 months.  In accordance with FASB Staff Position (""FSP"") FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, the following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of  67       September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):         2007         Less than 12 Months   12 Months or Greater   Total     Security Description    Fair Value   Unrealized Loss   Fair Value   Unrealized Loss   Fair Value   Unrealized Loss     U.S. Treasury and Agency securities   $ 338   $    $    $    $ 338   $      U.S. Corporate securities     2,521     (12 )   32          2,553     (12 )   Foreign securities     474     (1 )   8          482     (1 )                           Total   $ 3,333   $ (13 ) $ 40   $    $ 3,373   $ (13 )                                   2006         Less than 12 Months   12 Months or Greater   Total     Security Description    Fair Value   Unrealized Loss   Fair Value   Unrealized Loss   Fair Value   Unrealized Loss     U.S. Treasury and Agency securities   $ 234   $    $ 26   $    $ 260   $      U.S. Corporate securities     943          102     (1 )   1,045     (1 )   Foreign securities     164          34          198                                  Total   $ 1,341   $    $ 162   $ (1 ) $ 1,503   $ (1 )                            The unrealized losses on the Company's investments during 2007 in U.S. Corporate securities and foreign securities and during 2006 in U.S. Corporate securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities with strong liquidity and with low probabilities of default. The Company's investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature. During 2007, the Company did not record any material impairment on outstanding securities. As of September 29, 2007, the Company does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  Market values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.  Accounts Receivable   Trade Receivables   The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company requires collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not  68      covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. One customer accounted for approximately 11% of trade receivables as of September 29, 2007, while no customers accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 30, 2006.  The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in millions):         September 29, 2007   September 30, 2006   September 24, 2005     Beginning allowance balance   $ 52   $ 46   $ 47     Charged to costs and expenses     12     17     8     Deductions     (17 )   (11 )   (9 )                  Ending allowance balance   $ 47   $ 52   $ 46                     Vendor Non-Trade Receivables   The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current assets, totaled $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.  Derivative Financial Instruments   The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  69      The following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign currency instruments as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006 (in millions):         September 29, 2007   September 30, 2006       Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Foreign exchange instruments qualifying as accounting hedges:                                          Spot/Forward contracts   $  570   $  (8 ) $     $  351   $  6   $  6     Purchased options   $ 2,564   $ 10   $ 10   $ 1,256   $ 9   $ 9     Sold options   $ 1,498   $ (2 ) $    $ 80   $ (1 ) $     Foreign exchange instruments other than accounting hedges:                                                Spot/Forward contracts   $  1,768   $  (2 ) $     $  1,103   $  2   $  2     Purchased options   $ 161   $ 1   $ 1   $ 167   $ 1   $     The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates.  The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.  Foreign Exchange Risk Management   The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized.  70       Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases over a time horizon of up to 6 months.  Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company recognized net gains of approximately $672,000 and $421,000 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and a net loss of $1.6 million in 2005 in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. As of September 29, 2007, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $468,000, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008.  The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity. For the years ended September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the Company had a net loss of $2.6 million and a net gain of $7.4 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment.  The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.

During 2006, the Company sold certain assets related to its PowerSchool web-based student information system operations. In connection with this sale, the Company reduced goodwill by $31 million for the outstanding balance from the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. in 2001 and recognized a $4 million pre-tax gain, which is reflected in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  Expected annual amortization expense related to acquired technology is as follows (in millions):     Fiscal Years:           2008   $ 52     2009     37     2010     28     2011     25     2012     19     Thereafter     38          Total   $ 199           Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $35 million, $12 million, and $9 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  73        Note 5Income Taxes   The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):         2007   2006   2005     Federal:                         Current   $ 1,219   $ 619   $ 305       Deferred     85     56     144                          1,304     675     449                     State:                            Current     112     56     66       Deferred     9     14     (91 )                        121     70     (25 )                   Foreign:                            Current     103     101     59       Deferred     (16 )   (17 )   (3 )                        87     84     56                    Provision for income taxes   $ 1,512   $ 829   $ 480                     The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $2.2 billion, $1.5 billion, and $922 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As of September 29, 2007, $6.5 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company's consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $2.4 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  74       As of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):         2007   2006   Deferred tax assets:                 Accrued liabilities and other reserves   $ 679   $ 485     Tax losses and credits     8     55     Basis of capital assets and investments     146     124     Accounts receivable and inventory reserves     64     45     Other     161     30               Total deferred tax assets     1,058     739   Less valuation allowance     5     5             Net deferred tax assets     1,053     734             Deferred tax liabilities:                 Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries     803     514               Total deferred tax liabilities     803     514             Net deferred tax asset   $ 250   $ 220              As of September 29, 2007, the Company has tax loss and credit carryforwards in the tax effected amount of $8 million. As of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.  A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2007, 2006, and 2005) to income before provision for income taxes, is as follows (in millions):         2007   2006   2005     Computed expected tax   $ 1,753   $ 987   $ 633     State taxes, net of federal effect     140     86     (19 )   Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries     (297 )   (224 )   (98 )   Nondeductible executive compensation     6     11     14     Research and development credit, net     (54 )   (12 )   (26 )   Other items     (36 )   (19 )   (24 )                  Provision for income taxes   $ 1,512   $ 829   $ 480                    Effective tax rate     30 %   29 %   27 %    The Company's income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options. The Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. The net tax benefits from employee stock option transactions were $398 million, $419 million, and $428 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and were reflected as an increase to common stock in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.  75       The Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company intends to contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. In 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded tax benefits of $63 million and $20 million, respectively, due to the settlement of prior year tax audits in the U.S.  Note 6Shareholders' Equity   Preferred Stock   The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.  Restricted Stock Units   The Company's Board of Directors has granted RSUs to members of the Company's management team, excluding its CEO. These RSUs generally vest over four years either at the end of the four-year service period, in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, or in equal installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Upon vesting, the RSUs will convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The compensation expense incurred by the Company for RSUs is based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and is amortized ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The RSUs have been reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.  During 2007 and 2006, 45,000 and 2.47 million, respectively, previously granted RSUs vested. A majority of these vested RSUs were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees' minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of approximately 20,000 and 990,000 for 2007 and 2006, respectively, was based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the Company's closing stock price. Total payments for the employees' tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $3 million and $59 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.  CEO Restricted Stock Award   On March 19, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock to the Company's CEO that vested on March 19, 2006. The amount of the restricted stock award expensed by the Company was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and was amortized ratably on a straight-line basis over the three-year requisite service period. Upon vesting during 2006, the 10 million shares of restricted stock had a fair value of $646.6 million and had grant-date fair value of $7.48 per share. The restricted stock award was net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the CEO's minimum statutory obligation for the applicable  76      income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of 4.6 million were based on the value of the restricted stock award on the vesting date as determined by the Company's closing stock price of $64.66. The remaining shares net of those withheld were delivered to the Company's CEO. Total payments for the CEO's tax obligations to the taxing authorities was $296 million in 2006 and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net-share settlement had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not represent an expense to the Company. The Company's CEO has no remaining shares of restricted stock. For the years ended September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, compensation expense related to restricted stock was $4.6 million and $24.9 million, respectively.  Stock Repurchase Plan   In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. The Company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 29, 2007.  Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes (in millions):         2007   2006   2005     Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities   $ (7 ) $    $ (4 )   Unrealized gains on derivative instruments          3     4     Cumulative foreign currency translation     70     19                         Accumulated other comprehensive income   $ 63   $ 22   $                      The change in fair value of available-for-sale securities included in other comprehensive income was $(7) million, $4 million, and zero, net of taxes in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The tax effect related to the change in unrealized gain/loss on available-for-sale securities was $4 million, $(2) million, and zero for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  77       The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives, net of taxes, held by the Company (in millions):         2007   2006   2005   Changes in fair value of derivatives   $ (1 ) $ 11   $ 7   Adjustment for net (losses)/gains realized and included in net income     (2 )   (12 )   1                Change in unrealized gains on derivative instruments   $ (3 ) $ (1 ) $ 8                 The tax effect related to the changes in fair value of derivatives was $1 million, $(8) million, and $(3) million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The tax effect related to derivative gains/losses reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income was $2 million, $8 million, and $(2) million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  Employee Benefit Plans   2003 Employee Stock Plan   The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the ""2003 Plan"") is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. During 2007, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the 2003 Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 28 million shares.  1997 Employee Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the ""1997 Plan""), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan and no new options can be granted from this plan.  1997 Director Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (the ""Director Plan"") for non-employee directors of the Company, which was approved by shareholders in 1998. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Company's non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the Board (""Initial Options""). The Initial Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee director's initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (""Annual Options""). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant.  Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans   Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter Oppenheimer, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, and Dr. Bertrand Serlet, have entered into trading plans pursuant to  78      Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan   The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the ""Purchase Plan""), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. During 2007, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 6 million shares and limit the number of shares that may be purchased in any calendar year to 3 million shares. As of September 29, 2007, approximately 7 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.  Employee Savings Plan   The Company has an employee savings plan (the ""Savings Plan"") qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($15,500 for calendar year 2007). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's eligible earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan were $39 million, $33 million, and $28 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  79      Stock Option Activity   A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the last three fiscal years follows (stock award amounts and aggregate intrinsic value are presented in thousands):             Outstanding Options       Shares Available for Grant   Number of Shares   Weighted-Average Exercise Price   Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term   Aggregate Intrinsic Value   Balance at September 25, 2004   24,050   110,722   $ 10.52               Additional options authorized   49,000                       Restricted stock units granted   (460 )                     Options granted   (16,214 ) 16,214   $ 42.52               Options cancelled   3,844   (3,844 ) $ 13.28               Options exercised      (49,871 ) $ 10.05               Restricted stock units cancelled   230                       Plan shares expired   (1,493 )                                              Balance at September 24, 2005    58,957    73,221   $  17.79                 Restricted stock units granted   (2,950 )                     Options granted   (3,881 ) 3,881   $ 65.28               Options cancelled   2,325   (2,325 ) $ 29.32               Restricted stock units cancelled   625                       Options exercised      (21,795 ) $ 11.78               Plan shares expired   (82 )                                              Balance at September 30, 2006    54,994    52,982   $  23.23                 Additional shares authorized   28,000                       Restricted stock units granted   (2,640 )                     Options granted   (14,010 ) 14,010   $ 94.52               Options cancelled   1,471   (1,471 ) $ 55.38               Restricted stock units cancelled   20                       Options exercised      (15,770 ) $ 18.32               Plan shares expired   (8 )                                              Balance at September 29, 2007    67,827    49,751   $  43.91    4.57   $  5,450,528                             Exercisable at September 29, 2007       27,319   $ 23.13   3.80   $ 3,560,682    Expected to Vest after September 29, 2007         21,260   $  72.69    5.51   $  1,717,383    Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  The Company recognized $242 million, $163 million and $49 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalized stock-based compensation costs were $9 million as of September 29, 2007. There were no stock-based compensation costs capitalized as of September 30, 2006. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $81 million and $39 million for the years ended September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $631 million and $375 million as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost as of September 29, 2007, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.92 years.  80        Note 6Shareholders' Equity (Continued)   As of September 29, 2007, the Company had 4.7 million RSUs outstanding with a total grant-date fair value of $249 million that were excluded from the options outstanding balances in the preceding table. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $88.51 per share, $70.92 per share, and $45.04 per share, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs was $701.3 million and $262.5 million at September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. RSUs that vested during 2007 and 2006 totaled 45,000 and 2.47 million, respectively, and had a fair value of $6.1 million and $148.5 million, respectively, as of the vesting date. Shares of RSUs granted after April 2005 have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company's stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted.  Note 7Stock-Based Compensation   The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of the effect on net income and earnings per share for the year ended September 24, 2005 as if the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the BSM option-pricing model.  The Company uses the BSM option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  The weighted average assumptions used for 2007, 2006, and 2005 and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and for stock purchases during those periods are as follows:         2007   2006   2005     Expected life of stock options     3.46 years     3.56 years     3.57 years     Expected life of stock purchases     6 months     6 months     6 months     Interest ratestock options     4.61 %   4.60 %   3.73 %   Interest ratestock purchases     5.13 %   4.29 %   2.54 %   Volatilitystock options     38.13 %   40.34 %   39.52 %   Volatilitystock purchases     39.22 %   39.56 %   40.88 %   Dividend yields                    Weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year   $ 31.86   $ 23.16   $ 14.41     Weighted-average fair value of stock purchases during the year   $ 20.90   $ 14.06   $ 7.55      Note 8Commitments and Contingencies   Lease Commitments   The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 15 years and generally  81      provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 7 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 29, 2007, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $1.4 billion, of which $1.1 billion related to leases for retail space.  Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $151 million, $138 million, and $140 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 29, 2007, are as follows (in millions):     Fiscal Years        2008   $ 155   2009     172   2010     173   2011     160   2012     148   Thereafter     617          Total minimum lease payments   $ 1,425           Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications   The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company's hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.  The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the software's compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.  82       The following table reconciles changes in the Company's accrued warranties and related costs (in millions):         2007   2006   2005     Beginning accrued warranty and related costs   $ 284   $ 188   $ 105     Cost of warranty claims     (281 )   (267 )   (188 )   Accruals for product warranties     227     363     271                    Ending accrued warranty and related costs   $ 230   $ 284   $ 188                     The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 29, 2007 or September 30, 2006.  Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product   Certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits (""ASICs"") are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources which subjects the Company to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, DRAM memory, and certain LCDs, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of critical components at favorable pricing, and there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements when they expire. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can adversely affect gross margins and operating margins. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the global personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, iPods, iPhones, logic boards, and other assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Company's outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Company's key products, including but not limited to, assembly  83      of most of the Company's portable Mac computers, iPods, and iPhones. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments.  Long-Term Supply Agreements   During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $208 million of the prepayment as of September 29, 2007.  Contingencies   The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results.  Note 9Segment Information and Geographic Data   In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company reports segment information based on the ""management"" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.  The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail, and FileMaker operations. The Company's four geographical segments, together with the Retail segment, all sell the same products to the same types of customers. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail operations. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments exclude activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K. and Italy. Other operating segments include  84       Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products, similar services and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1.  The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of the customers, and net sales for the Retail segment are based on sales from the Company's retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $294 million, $200 million, and $132 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively.  From the establishment of the Retail segment in fiscal 2001 through the quarter ended March 31, 2007, Company management assessed the segment's operating performance differently from the Company's other operating segments. Because the Company's Retail initiative was an unproven concept at inception, management chose to measure the Retail segment's performance in a manner that would allow comparability to the Company's major channel partners operating retail stores in the U.S. There were three significant differences in the measurement of the Retail segment's results relative to the Company's other operating segments. First, the Retail segment's operating income reflected cost of sales for Apple products at amounts normally charged to Apple's major U.S. channel partners for the same products, less the cost of the Company's sales programs and other costs to support those partners. Second, the cost of sales of the Company's service and support contracts, including the AppleCare Protection Plan (""APP"") and .Mac, were reflected in the Retail segment's results at the costs charged to major channel partners for such contracts, and all associated revenue was reflected in the Retail segment's results at the time of sale rather than being amortized over the lives of the respective agreements. Because the Company had not yet earned the revenue or incurred the cost associated with the sale of such contracts, an offset to these amounts was recognized in other segments' net sales and cost of sales. Third, the Company allocated certain expenses related to the operation of its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense.  Having operated the Company's Retail stores successfully for more than six years, management believes its Retail initiative is a proven concept that will continue to be an integral element of the Company's distribution and marketing strategies. Additionally, the Company expects sales of iPhone by the Company's geographic and Retail operating segments to generate significant levels of deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales over time. In consideration of these factors, management has determined that beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2007, aligning measurements for the performance of the Retail segment with those used for the Company's other operating segments provides the most meaningful information. Accordingly, management has begun to measure the Retail segment's operating performance in a manner  85       generally consistent with the Company's other operating segments. The cost of sales of the Company's products sold through the Retail segment is now reflected at amounts similar to the cost of sales of the same products reflected in the Company's other operating segments. Revenue from APP and .Mac contracts sold through the Retail segment is now being recognized over the lives of the respective service agreements. Additionally, the Retail segment is applying the same subscription accounting to iPhone net sales and cost of sales that the Company's other operating segments apply. Management believes aligning measurements for the performance of the Retail segment with those used for the Company's other operating segments will provide greater comparability with the rest of the Company's segments and allow for more meaningful assessment of the Retail segment's operating results. The Company has reclassified prior period operating segment results to reflect these changes in the measurement of the operating results for the Retail segment, along with the corresponding offsetting impact to the Company's other operating segments.  The Company will continue to allocate certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. These high-profile stores are larger than the Company's typical retail stores and were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of eight high-profile stores as of September 29, 2007. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $39 million, $33 million, and $31 million for the years ended September 29, 2007, September 30, 2006, and September 24, 2005 respectively.  86       Summary information by operating segment follows (in millions):         2007   2006   2005   Americas:                       Net sales   $ 11,596   $ 9,415   $ 6,658     Operating income   $ 2,949   $ 1,899   $ 970     Depreciation, amortization, and accretion   $ 9   $ 6   $ 6     Segment assets (a)   $ 1,497   $ 896   $ 705    Europe:                          Net sales   $ 5,460   $ 4,096   $ 3,073     Operating income   $ 1,348   $ 627   $ 465     Depreciation, amortization, and accretion   $ 6   $ 4   $ 4     Segment assets   $ 595   $ 471   $ 289    Japan:                          Net sales   $ 1,082   $ 1,211   $ 924     Operating income   $ 232   $ 208   $ 147     Depreciation, amortization, and accretion   $ 3   $ 3   $ 3     Segment assets   $ 159   $ 181   $ 165    Retail:                          Net sales   $ 4,115   $ 3,246   $ 2,278     Operating income   $ 875   $ 600   $ 396     Depreciation, amortization, and accretion (b)   $ 88   $ 59   $ 43     Segment assets (b)   $ 1,085   $ 651   $ 589    Other Segments (c):                          Net sales   $ 1,753   $ 1,347   $ 998     Operating income   $ 388   $ 235   $ 118     Depreciation, amortization, and accretion   $ 3   $ 3   $ 2     Segment assets   $ 252   $ 180   $ 133       (a)The Americas asset figures do not include fixed assets held in the U.S. Such fixed assets are not allocated specifically to the Americas segment and are included in the corporate assets figures below.

The Company recognized a total of approximately $776,000, $202,000, and $1,100,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

On May 5, 2006, The Walt Disney Company (""Disney"") acquired Pixar, which resulted in Pixar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney. Upon Disney's acquisition of Pixar, Mr. Jobs' shares of Pixar common stock were exchanged for Disney's common stock and he was elected to the Disney Board of Directors. Royalty expense recognized by the Company under the arrangement with Pixar from September 25, 2005 through May 5, 2006 was less than $1 million.  89       Note 11Selected Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)   The following tables set forth a summary of the Company's quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters ended September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006 (in millions, except share and per share amounts):         Fourth Quarter   Third Quarter   Second Quarter   First Quarter   2007                           Net sales   $ 6,217   $ 5,410   $ 5,264   $ 7,115   Gross margin   $ 2,090   $ 1,995   $ 1,849   $ 2,220   Net income   $ 904   $ 818   $ 770   $ 1,004   Earnings per common share:                             Basic   $ 1.04   $ 0.94   $ 0.89   $ 1.17     Diluted   $ 1.01   $ 0.92   $ 0.87   $ 1.14   2006                           Net sales   $ 4,837   $ 4,370   $ 4,359   $ 5,749   Gross margin   $ 1,412   $ 1,325   $ 1,297   $ 1,564   Net income   $ 542   $ 472   $ 410   $ 565   Earnings per common share:                             Basic   $ 0.63   $ 0.55   $ 0.49   $ 0.68     Diluted   $ 0.62   $ 0.54   $ 0.47   $ 0.65    Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective September 25, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 15, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.             /s/ KPMG LLP             Mountain View, California November 15, 2007  91      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   The Board of Directors and Shareholders Apple Inc.:  We have audited Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Apple's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2007, based on criteria established in  Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29, 2007, and our report dated November 15, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.            /s/ KPMG LLP             Mountain View, California November 15, 2007  92             Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure      Not applicable.      Item 9A. Controls and Procedures      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (""Exchange Act"") were effective as of September 29, 2007 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls   The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:      (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.     Management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO""). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2007. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG  93      LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting appears on page 92 of this Form 10-K.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.      Item 9B. Other Information      On November 13, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company amended and restated the Company's Amended Bylaws to permit the issuance of uncertificated shares of stock and to make related conforming and mechanical changes. The foregoing description of the amendments to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Amended and Restated Bylaws, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.5 and is incorporated herein by reference.  94             PART III          Item 10.

Item 11. Executive Compensation          COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS      A.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   This section explains Apple's executive compensation program as it relates to the following ""named executive officers:""     Steve Jobs   Chief Executive Officer   Tim Cook   Chief Operating Officer   Peter Oppenheimer   Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer   Ron Johnson   Senior Vice President, Retail Sales   Tony Fadell   Senior Vice President, iPod Division    Apple's executive compensation program for the named executive officers consists of long-term equity awards in the form of restricted stock units (""RSUs"") and cash compensation in the form of performance-based cash incentives and base salaries. Each year, the Compensation Committee, which is made up entirely of independent directors, determines the compensation for the named executive officers.  Apple relies heavily on long-term equity awards to attract and retain an outstanding executive team and to ensure a strong connection between executive compensation and financial performance. An RSU award gives the named executive officer the right to receive, at no cost, a specified number of shares of Apple common stock when the award vests, typically at intervals of two to four years. Because the value of the RSUs depends on Apple's future share price, the award links compensation to future financial performance. The officer is generally not eligible to receive the shares if employment is terminated before the RSUs vest. The Compensation Committee reviews annually the outstanding, unvested equity awards of each named executive officer to determine, in the Committee's discretion, whether additional awards are warranted in light of the officer's performance, the competitive environment and the other factors discussed in Section D3 below.  The performance-based cash incentives compensate the named executive officers for achieving specific financial goals established annually by the Compensation Committee, as described in Section D4. The Committee sets aggressive performance goals each year based on the revenue and operating income objectives in Apple's internal business plan. Payments are not automatic, however, because the Committee may exercise its discretion to reduce (but not increase) the amount of any incentive payment based on an officer's overall performance.  Based on the factors discussed in Section D3 below and the Committee's belief that the outstanding, unvested equity awards still had significant retention value, the Committee made no new equity awards to the named executive officers in fiscal 2007. The officers earned cash incentives in fiscal 2007 at the maximum amount allowed by the plan100% of base salarybecause Apple's financial performance significantly exceeded the annual performance goals set by the Committee. The Committee assessed both the amount and allocation of the compensation components for each officer based on Apple's overall annual financial performance and each officer's individual performance. The Committee did not increase base salaries for the named executive officers because it concluded that the total compensation for each officer was appropriate.  99       Apple's shareholders have been generously rewarded for Apple's success, with a three-year annualized shareholder return of 101% through the end of fiscal 2007. The Committee believes the compensation of the named executive officers has been appropriate and fair in light of Apple's performance.  B.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES   Apple's goal for executive compensation is simple: attract and retain an exceptionally talented, entrepreneurial and creative team of executives who will provide the leadership for Apple's success in dynamic, highly-competitive markets.  C.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OVERVIEW     1. Three Components    The compensation program for the named executive officers consists of the following three components, in order of their importance:    Long-term equity awards in the form of RSUs under the shareholder-approved Employee Stock Plan Annual performance-based cash incentives under the shareholder-approved Performance Bonus Plan (the CEO, however, does not participate in this plan and is not eligible for performance-based cash incentives) Base salary       The named executive officers are also eligible to participate in Apple's health and welfare programs, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 401(k) Plan, patent bonus program and other minor employee recognition programs on the same basis as other employees.    2. Mix of Equity, Cash Incentives and Salary  Apple relies heavily on long-term equity awards because the Compensation Committee believes they are the most effective compensation element for attracting entrepreneurial, creative executives and promoting their long-term commitment to Apple. An RSU award generally vests only if the named executive officer continues employment until the specified vesting date, typically two to four years after the date of grant. Equity awards also help to ensure a strong connection between executive compensation and Apple's financial performance because the value of RSUs depends on Apple's future share price.  Although the Compensation Committee reviews the compensation practices of its peer companies as described in Section D6 below, the Committee does not adhere to strict formulas or survey data to determine the mix of compensation elements. Instead, as described in Section D, the Committee considers various factors in exercising its discretion to determine compensation, including the experience, responsibilities and performance of each named executive officer as well as Apple's overall financial performance. This flexibility is particularly important in designing compensation arrangements to attract new executives in highly-competitive, rapidly changing markets.    3. Elements of Compensation Not Included In The Compensation Program    The current compensation program for the named executive officers, including the CEO, does not include the following:   Employment contracts    100         Cash bonuses other than the performance-based cash incentives under the Performance Bonus Plan and payments under the patent bonus program Severance and change of control arrangements beyond what is available to all U.S. employees (with the exception of rights to accelerated vesting previously granted as part of equity awards that will fully vest in March 2008) Perquisites or personal benefits that are not available to employees generally Guarantees of the value of equity awards      4. CEO Compensation     Apple's CEO, Steve Jobs, currently holds approximately 5.5 million shares of Apple common stock. Since rejoining Apple in 1997, Mr. Jobs has never sold a share of Apple stock. His last equity grant was awarded in 2003, and vested in full in 2006. Mr. Jobs currently holds no unvested equity awards. In fiscal 2007, Mr. Jobs's entire compensation consisted of his $1 annual salary. Because Mr. Jobs's continued leadership is critical to Apple, the Compensation Committee is considering additional compensation arrangements for him.  Mr. Jobs has received a $1 annual salary since he rejoined Apple in 1997 and began serving as interim CEO. In 1999, Apple awarded Mr. Jobs an aircraft as an executive bonus in recognition of his outstanding performance during the previous two years. Mr. Jobs also received two stock option grants, one in 2000 and another in 2001. Mr. Jobs never exercised these grants, and they were both cancelled in March 2003, when Apple awarded Mr. Jobs a grant of 5 million shares of restricted stock.  The 2003 restricted stock grant required Mr. Jobs to remain employed by Apple for three more years before it vested. This grant, which increased to 10 million shares when Apple's common stock split in 2005, vested in full in March 2006. After a portion of these shares was withheld for the payment of taxes, Mr. Jobs received the remaining 5,426,447 shares. Due in large part to Mr. Jobs's leadership, Apple's stock price (after accounting for a stock split) increased from $7.47 on the March 2003 grant date to $64.66 on the March 2006 vesting datemore than an eight-fold increase in three years. Under Mr. Jobs's continued leadership, Apple's stock price increased from $64.66 per share in March 2006 to $189.95 per share as of October 31, 2007a three-fold increase in approximately 18 months.  When he was elected to Apple's Board of Directors in 1997, Mr. Jobs received the standard director's stock option grant for 30,000 shares. Because Mr. Jobs became employed later that year as Apple's interim CEO, he was no longer eligible for such director grants. When the 1997 director grant (which increased to 120,000 shares after two stock splits) was due to expire in August 2007, Mr. Jobs exercised the option and he currently holds these 120,000 shares.    D.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION     1. Team-Based Compensation  The compensation program for the named executive officers rests on two assumptions. First, each officer must demonstrate exceptional personal performance in order to remain part of the executive team. Second, each officer must contribute as a member of the team to Apple's overall success rather than merely achieve specific objectives within that officer's area of responsibility.    2. Independent Compensation Committee Determines All Executive Compensation  The Compensation Committee determines all compensation for the named executive officers. All three Committee members are independent of Apple's management.    101        During the first quarter of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee conducts an evaluation of each named executive officer to determine if any changes in the officer's compensation are appropriate based on the considerations described below. The CEO does not participate in the Committee's deliberations or decision with regard to his compensation. At the Committee's request, the CEO reviews with the Committee the performance of the other four named executive officers, but no other named executive officer has any input into executive compensation decisions. The Committee gives considerable weight to the CEO's evaluation of the other named executive officers because of his direct knowledge of each officer's performance and contributions. For each officer, the Committee members independently determine each component of compensation based on their collective assessment of the officer's performance as well as Apple's overall financial performance.    3. The Crucial Role of Long-Term Equity Awards  Overview.    The Committee believes that long-term equity awards are the most effective way to attract and retain a superlative executive team. Accordingly, executive compensation is heavily weighted toward long-term equity awards rather than cash compensation, and the awards have long vesting intervals to maximize their retention value. This approach is reflected in the following:    The CEO's compensation has been generally tied to long-term equity; for example, his last equity award did not vest for three years. For the other four named executive officers, equity awards represented approximately 85% of their target total compensation in fiscal 2007. This compares to approximately 70% at Apple's peer companies. Fiscal 2004 equity awards vested 50% on the second anniversary of the grant date; the remaining 50% will vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Fiscal 2006 equity awards do not vest at all until 2010, when they vest in full.       In designing long-term equity awards, the Committee seeks to maximize their effectiveness in accomplishing Apple's compensation objectives while recognizing the Board's duty to Apple's shareholders to limit equity dilution. The Committee believes this balance has been achieved as follows:  Restricted Stock Units Minimize Dilution and Support Long-Term Focus.    Since fiscal 2004, all equity awards to the named executive officers have been RSUs rather than stock options. A grant of RSUs gives an officer the right to receive a specified number of shares of Apple common stock, at no cost to the officer, if the officer remains employed at Apple until the RSUs vest. RSUs granted in 2004 also provide for accelerated vesting if the named executive officer is terminated without cause or on a change of control, RSUs granted before 2007 provide for accelerated vesting on a change of control, and all RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon the death of the officer. The compensation value of an RSU does not depend solely on future stock price increases; at grant, its value is equal to Apple's stock price. Although its value may increase or decrease with changes in the stock price during the period before vesting, an RSU will have value in the long term, encouraging retention. By contrast, the entire compensation value of a stock option depends on future stock price appreciation. Accordingly, RSUs can deliver significantly greater share-for-share compensation value at grant than stock options, and Apple can offer comparable grant date compensation value with fewer shares and less dilution for its shareholders.  Long Vesting Intervals to Maximize Retention.    All vesting of RSUs is generally subject to continued employment. Except for occasional new hire grants, vesting occurs at intervals of no    102         less than two years after the grant date. This ensures that a meaningful portion of a named executive officer's awards will vest every two yearsa strong incentive to continue employment with Apple. The following table shows the grant and vesting patterns for ongoing RSU grants for the named executive officers since fiscal 2004 (excluding those who were not named executive officers at the time of grant).       Equity Awards    FY05 vesting   FY06 vesting   FY07 vesting   FY08 vesting   FY09 vesting   FY10 vesting     Fiscal 2004 RSU (excluding CEO)      50 %    50 %           Fiscal 2006 RSU (excluding CEO)                  100 %      Vesting Conditions.    As noted above, the vesting of all RSUs is generally contingent on the named executive officer's continued employment with Apple, rather than on performance with regard to specific business objectives. From time to time, the Compensation Committee has considered various forms of performance-based vesting. After careful evaluation, the Committee has concluded that performance-based vesting would not serve Apple's current objectives as effectively as the program described above. The Committee generally grants RSUs with two to four year vesting periods to maximize the award's retention value. This retention value would be undermined if a named executive officer's equity awards (which represent approximately 85% of the officer's compensation) were at risk based on performance measures that were determined two or even four years prior to the vesting date. Given the intensely dynamic business environment in which Apple operates, it would be extremely difficult to craft meaningful objectives with such a long horizon. Apple imposes no requirement that the named executive officers hold their common stock for any period after vesting.  Annual Burn Rate Averages Less Than 2.5%.    In fiscal 2005, Apple committed to an annual ""burn rate"" (the total number of all equity award shares granted during the fiscal year divided by the total shares outstanding at the end of the fiscal year) of 2.5% from fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2007. This commitment represented a significant reduction from an average burn rate of 4.8% from fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004. In fact, Apple's average annual burn rate from fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2007 was approximately 1.6%.  Overhang from Equity Plans at 12.9%.    Overhang (granted and outstanding equity awards plus shares reserved for future awards, divided by the sum of total shares outstanding, granted and outstanding equity awards, and shares reserved for future awards) is another measure of equity dilution. The efficient use of equity awards, combined with the substantial exercise of employee stock options due to the significant increase in Apple's stock price over the past few years, has caused Apple's overhang to decline from approximately 14.5% at the end of fiscal 2005 to approximately 12.9% at the end of fiscal 2007.  Frequency and Size of Equity Awards.    The named executive officers typically receive equity awards every two years, rather than every year. This practice is consistent with the long time horizon and lengthy vesting periods of the awards. By making awards less frequently, the Committee can provide larger grants, which in turn promotes greater retention.  To determine the size of RSU grants, the Compensation Committee first establishes a target compensation value that it wants to deliver to the named executive officers through long-term equity awards. In doing so, the Committee considers various factors, including the following:    The practice of granting equity only every two years The heavy weight placed on equity in the mix of total compensation     103            The officer's experience and performance The scope, responsibility and business impact of the officer's position The perceived retention value of the total compensation package in light of the competitive environment       Once the target value has been established, the Committee determines the number of shares by reference to the current value of Apple's common stock.    4. The Minor Role of Cash Compensation    Base Salaries.    The Committee believes that base salaries are significantly less important than performance-based bonuses and long-term equity awards in meeting Apple's compensation objectives. The minor role of salaries as part of total compensation is reflected in the following:    The CEO has received an annual base salary of $1 since rejoining Apple in 1997. The fiscal 2007 average base salary for the other named executive officers was below median among the peer companies shown in Section D6, despite Apple's significantly greater financial and business success. Base salaries for the named executive officers have not increased since October 2005, except for a promotion-related increase for one officer.       Performance-Based Cash Incentives.    The Performance Bonus Plan, which has been approved by Apple's shareholders, authorizes the Committee to issue plan-based cash incentive awards to compensate officers for achieving specific financial objectives that are established annually. The Committee believes that performance-based cash compensation is an important component of executive compensation; however, it represents a small percentage of total compensation because its effectiveness in meeting Apple's compensation objectives is limited. It is a less significant factor in attracting new executive talent than equity compensation, and it promotes retention only in the short-termover the performance period. Accordingly, the plan is modestly funded, as reflected by the following:    The CEO does not participate in the Performance Bonus Plan. Apple's target payout of 50% of base salary is significantly lower than peer companies as a group, where median target bonus payouts range from 100% to 160% of base salary. The maximum payout of 100% for exceptional performance is also lower than peer companies, where 3 times the target range (i.e., 300% to 480% of base salary) is becoming increasingly common.       The Compensation Committee establishes performance goals each year based on revenue and operating income objectives in Apple's internal business plan. The Committee has selected these performance goals because they are important indicators of increased shareholder value. These performance goals generally exclude the effects of extraordinary, unusual or infrequently occurring events or changes in accounting principles. Apple does not publicly disclose specific annual internal revenue or operating income objectives, as its business plan is highly confidential. Disclosing specific objectives would provide competitors and other third parties with insights into the planning process and would therefore cause competitive harm.  The Committee next determines the maximum amount of any cash incentive payment denominated as a percentage of base salary. The current payment structure is shown in the payout matrix below. Once the performance goals and payment structure are established, no one has the authority to modify or waive them.    104                           Percentage of Salary Payable As Performance-Based Cash Incentives          Revenue     Operating Income    Below Objective   Meet Objective   Above Objective     Below Objective   0 % 25 % up to 50 %   Meet Objective   25 % 50 % up to 75 %   Above Objective   up to 50 % up to 75 % up to 100 %      The performance goals are aggressive. Thus, there is considerable risk that payments will not be made at all or will be made at less than 100%. For the past three years, the performance goals have reflected double-digit growth in both revenue and operating income. In four of the past eight years, Apple did not meet one or both performance goals. This uncertainty ensures that any payments under the plan are truly performance-based, consistent with the plan's objectives.  At the end of the year, the Committee determines the amount of the award to be paid to each officer by comparing actual results to the performance goals. The Committee may, in its discretion, reduce (but not increase) the amount of any individual award based on the officer's overall performance. The plan does not provide for the adjustment or recovery of an award paid to a named executive officer if the results in a previous year are subsequently restated or adjusted in a manner that would have originally resulted in a smaller award.    5. The Role of Consultants    The Compensation Committee has selected and directly retained the services of Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc., an executive compensation consulting firm. No member of the Compensation Committee or any named executive officer has any affiliation with F.W. Cook. The Committee periodically seeks input from F.W. Cook on a range of external market factors, including evolving compensation trends, appropriate comparison companies and market survey data. F.W. Cook also provides general observations on Apple's compensation programs, but it does not determine or recommend the amount or form of compensation for any executives.    6. The Role of Peer Groups, Surveys and Benchmarking    With the assistance of F.W. Cook, the Committee identified peer companies for fiscal 2007 that compete with Apple in the labor and capital markets and that follow similar pay models. The Committee established the two peer groups listed below, one consisting of large technology companies and another consisting of large retailers. The retail peer group is a relevant comparison group for the Senior Vice President, Retail Sales; the technology peer group is relevant for the other four named executive officers.       Technology Companies   Retail Companies   Adobe Systems Amazon.com Applied Materials Cisco Systems Comcast Dell eBay EMC Google Hewlett-Packard   IBM Intel Microsoft Motorola Oracle Qualcomm Sprint Nextel Sun Microsystems Texas Instruments Xerox   The Gymboree Corporation Limited Brands Nike Polo Ralph Lauren Restoration Hardware Sharper Image Target Tiffany & Co. Tween Brands Wal-Mart    105        The Committee reviews compensation practices at peer companies (gathered from SEC filings and the Radford High Technology compensation survey) at a high level to ensure that Apple's total compensation is within a reasonably competitive range. The Committee, however, does not attempt to set compensation components to meet specific benchmarks, such as salaries ""above the median"" or equity compensation ""at the 75th percentile."" Furthermore, the Committee believes that excessive reliance on benchmarking is detrimental to shareholder interests because it can result in compensation that is unrelated to the value delivered by the named executive officers.    7. Tax and Accounting Considerations    Tax Deductibility of Compensation Expense.    Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1,000,000 on the amount of compensation to certain officers that may be deducted by Apple as a business expense in any tax year unless, among other things, the compensation is performance-based and has been approved by the shareholders. To qualify as performance-based compensation, the amount of compensation must depend on the officer's performance against pre-determined performance goals established by a committee that consists solely of at least two ""outside"" directors who have never been employed by Apple or its subsidiaries. Two Compensation Committee members, Mr. Gore and Mr. Drexler, qualify as outside directors under the IRS definition. Although Mr. Campbell is an independent director under SEC and NASDAQ governance standards, he does not qualify as an outside director because he was an officer of Apple from 1983 to 1987 and an Apple subsidiary from 1987 to 1991. For this reason, he does not discuss or vote on any Section 162(m)-related matters.  Salaries for the named executive officers do not qualify as performance-based compensation. Apple's performance-based cash incentives, however, are exempt from the Section 162(m) limit because they are paid based on predetermined goals established by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the shareholder-approved Performance Bonus Plan. The RSUs do not qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) because vesting is based on continued employment rather than specific performance goals. See page 103 for an explanation of Apple's decision not to implement performance-based vesting.  Tax Implications for Officers.    Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code imposes additional income taxes on executive officers for certain types of deferred compensation that do not comply with Section 409A. Because Apple does not generally provide deferred compensation to the named executive officers, this limitation has no impact on the structure of the compensation program for the officers. Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on payments to executives of severance or change of control compensation that exceed the levels specified in Section 280G. The named executive officers could receive the amounts shown on the table on page 113 as severance or change of control payments, but the Committee does not consider their potential impact in compensation program design.  Accounting Considerations.    The Committee also considers the accounting and cash flow implications of various forms of executive compensation. In its financial statements, Apple records salaries and performance-based compensation incentives as expenses in the amount paid, or to be paid, to the named executive officers. Accounting rules also require Apple to record an expense in its financial statements for equity awards, even though equity awards are not paid as cash to employees. The accounting expense of equity awards to employees is calculated in accordance with SFAS 123R. The Committee believes, however, that the many advantages of equity compensation, as discussed above, more than compensate for the non-cash accounting expense associated with them.    106           E.    Fiscal 2007 Compensation Decisions     1. No Equity Grants or Salary Changes   In fiscal 2007, the Committee did not grant new equity awards or increase base salaries for the named executive officers. Based on its assessment of the factors discussed above and the Committee's belief that the outstanding, unvested equity grants at the beginning of fiscal 2007 had significant retention value, the Committee concluded that the compensation packages for the named executive officers were reasonable without additional equity awards. The outstanding equity grants at the end of fiscal 2007 are shown on the Outstanding Equity Awards table on pages 110 and 111. Based on a review of competitive practices and the Committee's approach to place less emphasis on cash compensation, the Committee concluded that the total compensation for the officers were appropriate for fiscal 2007 without a salary increase.   2. 2007 Performance-Based Cash Incentive Plan Payments   Apple's fiscal 2007 performance significantly exceeded the revenue and operating income goals established under the cash incentive plan, so the Committee, in the exercise of its discretion, approved payouts to the named executive officers at the maximum of 100% of base salary, pursuant to the payout matrix on page 105. The specific payment amounts are shown in the Summary Compensation Table at page 108.   Compensation Committee Report(1)    The Compensation Committee has certain duties and powers as described in its charter. The Compensation Committee is currently composed of the three non-employee directors named at the end of this report, each of whom is independent as defined by the NASDAQ listing standards.

Compensation of Named Executive Officers   The Summary Compensation Table above quantifies the value of the different forms of compensation earned by or awarded to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2007. The primary elements of each  108      Named Executive Officer's total compensation reported in the table are base salary, an annual bonus, and long-term equity incentives consisting of restricted stock units and, in the case of Mr. Fadell, a patent award and stock options received prior to his appointment as an executive of the Company. Named Executive Officers also earned the other benefits listed in Column (i) of the Summary Compensation Table, as further described in footnotes 3, 4, 5 and 7 to the table. As noted above, the Company does not have employment agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers.  The Summary Compensation Table should be read in conjunction with the tables and narrative descriptions that follow. The Grants of Plan-Based Awards table, and the accompanying description of the material terms of the stock options and restricted stock unit awards granted in fiscal year 2007, provides information regarding the long-term equity incentives awarded to Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2007. The Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End and Option Exercises and Stock Vested tables provide further information on the Named Executive Officers' potential realizable value and actual value realized with respect to their equity awards.

(2)The unvested portion of this restricted stock unit award is scheduled to vest in its entirety on March 24, 2008. (3)The unvested portion of this restricted stock unit award is scheduled to vest in its entirety on March 24, 2010.

The dollar amounts shown in Column (e) above for stock awards are determined by multiplying the number of shares or units, as applicable, that vested by the per-share closing price of the Company's common stock on the vesting date. (2)These shares were acquired by Mr. Jobs on August 13, 2007 through an exercise of stock options granted to him under the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan that were to expire on August 14, 2007. Mr. Jobs has not sold any of the shares acquired in that exercise.  Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control   As noted above, the Company does not have employment agreements with any of its Named Executive Officers, nor does the Company maintain any other plans or arrangements that provide for any Named Executive Officer to receive cash severance or other cash payments in connection with a termination of their employment with the Company and/or a change in control of the Company.  Effective for grants made after April 9, 2007, the Company's 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the ""2003 Plan"") was amended to eliminate accelerated vesting of outstanding awards in connection with a change in control of the Company. With respect to awards granted under the 2003 Plan prior to that date, such awards, to the extent then outstanding and unvested, will generally become fully vested and, in the case of options, exercisable upon a change in control of the Company, unless the Compensation Committee provides for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation of such awards. Any options that become vested in connection with a change in control generally must be exercised prior to the change in control, or they will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment in connection with the change in control transaction.  The award agreements evidencing certain grants of restricted stock units to the Company's Named Executive Officers prior to January 1, 2005 generally provide that if, in connection with a change in control of the Company, the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason (as those terms are defined in the applicable award agreement), the restricted stock units that are then outstanding and unvested will vest in full.  The following table lists the Named Executive Officers and the estimated amounts they would have become entitled to under the terms of stock option and restricted stock unit awards granted to them under the 2003 Plan prior to April 9, 2007 had a change of control of the Company occurred on September 29,  112       2007, unless the Compensation Committee had provided for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation of such awards.

For a discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the amounts referred to above, please see the discussion of stock awards and option awards contained in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Form 10-K in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 7, ""Stock-Based Compensation."" (2)The following table presents the number of outstanding and unexercised option awards and the number of unvested stock awards held by each of the Non-Employee Directors as of September 29, 2007.      Director    Number of Shares Subject to Outstanding Options as of 9/29/07   Number of Unvested Shares of Restricted Stock as of 9/29/07   William V. Campbell   110,000      Millard S. Drexler   190,000      Albert A. Gore, Jr.   70,000      Arthur D. Levinson, Ph.D.   110,000      Eric E. Schmidt, Ph.D.         Jerome B. York   50,000        (3)As described below, the Company granted each of its Non-Employee Directors (other than Dr. Schmidt) an option to purchase 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock during fiscal year 2007. These grants were made on the anniversary of the director's initial election or appointment to the Board of Directors and had the following fair values on the applicable grant date: Mr. Campbell, $476,200; Mr. Drexler, $378,400; Mr. Gore, $300,300; Dr. Levinson, $448,000; and Mr. York, $476,200. See footnote (1) for the assumptions used to value these awards. (4)The amount reported in column (g) above consists solely of one or more of a limited number of free computer systems and/or additional equipment pursuant to the Board of Directors Equipment Program.  113      Compensation of Directors   The form and amount of director compensation are determined by the Board after a review of recommendations made by the Nominating Committee. The current practice of the Board is to base a substantial portion of a director's annual retainer on equity. Under the Company's 1997 Director Stock Option Plan (the ""Director Plan""), the Company's Non-Employee Directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of the Company's common stock upon their initial election to the Board (an ""Initial Option""). Initial Options vest and become exercisable in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a Non-Employee Director's initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the director is granted an option to acquire 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock (an ""Annual Option""). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on the date of grant.  Upon his initial appointment to the Board on August 29, 2006, Dr. Schmidt declined the annual retainer fee and the automatic stock option grant to purchase 30,000 shares to which new directors are entitled under the Director Plan. Instead, Dr. Schmidt purchased 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock on the open market.  Non-Employee directors also receive a $50,000 annual retainer paid in quarterly installments. Beginning in the 2008 fiscal year, the chairperson of the Audit and Finance Committee will also be entitled to an annual retainer of $25,000, in addition to the annual retainer paid to all non-employee directors. Directors do not receive any additional consideration for serving as a member or chairperson of any other committee. In addition, directors receive up to two free computer systems per year and are eligible to purchase additional equipment at a discount.  Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation   The Compensation Committee members whose names appear on the Compensation Committee Report above were committee members during all of fiscal year 2007. Mr. Campbell formerly served as an officer of the Company and of FileMaker, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company. No other member of the Compensation Committee is or has been a former or current executive officer of the Company, and no member of the Compensation Committee had any relationships requiring disclosure by the Company under the SEC's rules requiring disclosure of certain relationships and related-party transactions. None of the Company's executive officers served as a director or a member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, the executive officers of which served as a director or member of the Compensation Committee during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2007.  114             Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters      Equity Compensation Plan Information   The following table sets forth certain information, as of September 29, 2007, concerning shares of common stock authorized for issuance under all of the Company's equity compensation plans.

The grant of 4,675,000 restricted stock units has been deducted from the number of shares available for future issuance. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted after April 2005 count against the shares available for grant as two shares for every share granted. This number excludes shares under the 1990 Stock Option Plan that was terminated in 1997. No new options can be granted under the 1990 Stock Option Plan. (2)This table does not include 350 shares of common stock underlying options assumed in connection with a prior acquisition of a company that originally granted those options. These assumed options have a weighted average exercise price of $3.42 per share. No additional options may be granted under the assumed plan.   Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners   The following table sets forth certain information as of September 29, 2007 (the ""Table Date"") with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock by (i) each person the Company believes beneficially holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock; (ii) each director; (iii) each Named Executive Officer listed in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading ""Information Regarding Executive Compensation;"" and (iv) all directors and executive officers as a group. On the Table Date, 872,328,972 shares of the Company's common stock were issued and outstanding.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence      Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons   The Board of Directors has adopted a written policy for approval of transactions between the Company and its directors, director nominees, executive officers, greater than five percent beneficial owners and their respective immediate family members, where the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or is expected to exceed $120,000 in a single calendar year. A copy of this policy is available on the Company's website at www.apple.com/investor.  The policy provides that the Audit Committee reviews certain transactions subject to the policy and determines whether or not to approve or ratify those transactions. In doing so, the Audit Committee takes into account, among other factors it deems appropriate:    the related person's interest in the transaction; the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the transaction; the approximate dollar value of the amount of the related person's interest in the transaction without regard to the amount of any profit or loss; whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of business of the Company; whether the transaction with the related person is proposed to be, or was, entered into on terms no less favorable to the Company than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party; the purpose of, and the potential benefits to the Company of, the transaction; and any other information regarding the transaction or the related person in the context of the proposed transaction that would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of the particular transaction.   In addition, the Audit Committee has delegated authority to the Chair of the Audit Committee to pre-approve or ratify certain transactions. A summary of any new transactions pre-approved or ratified by the Chair is provided to the full Audit Committee for its review in connection with its next scheduled Audit Committee meeting.  The Audit Committee has considered and adopted standing pre-approvals under the policy for limited transactions with related persons. Pre-approved transactions include:    employment of executive officers, subject to certain conditions; any compensation paid to a director if the compensation is required to be reported in the Company's proxy statement under Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC;   117          any transaction with another company at which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer or director) or beneficial owner of less than ten percent of that company's equity, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1,000,000, or two percent of that company's total annual revenue; any charitable contribution, grant or endowment by the Company to a charitable organization, foundation or university at which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer or director), if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the lesser of $1,000,000, or two percent of the charitable organization's total annual receipts; and any transaction where the related person's interest arises solely from the ownership of the Company's common stock and all holders of the Company's common stock received the same benefit on a pro rata basis, such as dividends.   A summary of new transactions covered by the standing pre-approvals described above is provided to the Audit Committee for its review at each regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting. The related person transactions described below were approved by the Board of Directors before this policy was adopted.  Transactions with Related Persons     The Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Company recognized a total of $776,000, $202,000, and $1,100,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The Company enters into commercial dealings with The Walt Disney Company, Genentech and Google that it considers arms-length, including sales arrangements and, in the case of Google, licensing agreements and similar arrangements and, in the case of The Walt Disney Company, iTunes Store content licensing agreements and similar agreements. The Company enters into these commercial dealings in the ordinary course of its business. Mr. Jobs is a Director of The Walt Disney Company. Dr. Levinson is the Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Genentech. Dr. Schmidt is the Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Google and Mr. Gore is a Senior Advisor to Google. The Company does not believe that any of Messrs. Jobs or Gore or Drs. Levinson or Schmidt has a material direct or indirect interest in any of such commercial dealings.   The Board has determined all Board members, excluding Steve Jobs, are independent under the applicable NASDAQ rules. The Board has also determined the members of each committee of the Board are independent under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In making these determinations, the Board considered, among other things, the types and amounts of the commercial dealings between the Company and the companies and organizations with which the directors are affiliated.  Tony Fadell's spouse is the Vice President, Human Resources of the Company. She earned $318,467 in salary and $218,750 in bonus during fiscal year 2007 and participates in the Company's equity award and benefit programs. Her compensation is commensurate with that of her peers.   Director Independence   The Board has determined all Board members, excluding Steve Jobs, are independent under the applicable NASDAQ rules. The Board has also determined the members of each committee of the Board are independent under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In making these determinations, the Board considered, among other things, the types and amounts of the commercial dealings between the Company and the companies and organizations with which the directors are affiliated.  118          Item 14.

The Company does not engage KPMG to perform personal tax services for its executive officers.  Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Performed by the Independent Auditors   Prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the ""Act""), the Company adopted an auditor independence policy that banned its auditors from performing non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This auditor independence policy also mandates that the audit and non-audit services and related budget be approved by the Audit Committee in advance, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. In accordance with this policy, all services to be performed by KPMG were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.  Subsequent to the enactment of the Act, the Audit Committee met with KPMG to further understand the provisions of the Act as it relates to auditor independence. KPMG previously rotated the lead audit partner in fiscal year 2005 in compliance with the Act. KPMG also rotated other partners in 2007 and 2006, and will rotate additional partners as appropriate. The Audit Committee will continue to monitor the activities undertaken by KPMG to comply with the Act.  119             PART IV      Item 15.

"Item 1. Business Company Background Apple Computer, Inc. (Apple or the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on January 3, 1977. The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short films, and television shows. The Companys products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPod digital music player, the Xserve G5 server and Xserve RAID storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, the iTunes Music Store, a portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value added resellers. The Company also sells a variety of third-party products that are compatible with the Companys Macintosh and iPod product lines, including computer printers and printing supplies, storage devices, computer memory, digital camcorders and still cameras, personal digital assistants, iPod accessories, and various other computing products and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented in this Form 10-K is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. Business Strategy The Company is committed to bringing the best personal computing and music experience to students, educators, creative professionals, businesses, government agencies, and consumers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, services, and Internet offerings. The Companys business strategy leverages its unique ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to facilitate innovation of new and improved products and technologies. Besides updates to its existing line of personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions, the Company continues to capitalize on the convergence of digital consumer electronics and the computer by creating innovations like the iPod and iTunes Music Store. The Companys strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more of its targeted customers and provide them a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience. Digital Hub The Company believes personal computing is in an era in which the personal computer functions for both professionals and consumers as the digital hub for advanced new digital devices such as the Companys  1    iPod digital music players, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, digital camcorders and still cameras, CD and DVD players, televisions, and other consumer electronic devices. The attributes of the personal computer include a high quality user interface, relatively inexpensive data storage, and the ability to run complex applications and easily connect to the Internet. Apple is the only company in the personal computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire personal computerfrom the hardware and operating system to sophisticated applications. Additionally, the Companys products provide innovative industrial design, intuitive ease-of-use, and built-in networking, graphics and multimedia capabilities. Thus, the Company is uniquely positioned to offer integrated digital hub products and solutions. The Company develops products and technologies that adhere to many industry standards in order to provide an optimized user experience through interoperability with peripherals and devices from other companies. The Company has played a role in the development, enhancement, promotion, and/or use of numerous of these industry standards. Expanded Distribution The Company believes that a high quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Companys products and services is critical to attracting and retaining customers. The Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which consists of the deployment of Apple employees and contractors to selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Macintosh computer and other products over those of its competitors. The Company has significantly increased the points of distribution for the iPod product family in order to make its products available at locations where its customers shop. From inception of the retail initiative in 2001 through 2005, the Company had opened 116 retail stores in the U.S. and 8 international stores in Canada, Japan, and the U.K. The Company opened 2 additional stores in October 2005.  The Company has typically located its stores at high traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. One of the goals of the retail initiative is to bring new customers to the Company and expand its installed base through sales to computer users who currently do not own a Macintosh computer and first time personal computer buyers. By operating its own stores and building them in desirable high traffic locations, the Company is able to better control the customer retail experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of personal computing products. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes in order to accommodate market demands. The stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice and certain hardware support services. The stores offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software, and various other computing products and supplies selected to complement the Companys own products. Additionally, the stores provide a forum in which the Company is able to present computing solutions to users in areas such as digital photography, digital video, music, childrens software, and home and small business computing. Education For more than 25 years, the Company has focused on the use of technology in education and has been committed to delivering tools to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement, especially when used to support collaboration, information access, and the expression and representation  2    of student thought and ideas. The Company creates solutions that enable new modes of curriculum delivery, better ways of conducting research, and opportunities for professional development of faculty, students, and staff. The Company has designed a range of products and services to help schools maximize their investments in technology. This is manifested in many of the Companys products and services that are designed to meet the needs of education customers. These products and services include the eMacTM, iMacTM, and the iBook, video creation and editing solutions, wireless networking, student information systems,  high-quality curriculum and professional development solutions, and one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions (primarily in K-12). 1:1 learning solutions typically consist of iBook portable computers for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. Creative Professionals Creative professionals constitute one of the Companys most important markets for both hardware and software products. This market is also important to many third-party developers who provide Macintosh-compatible hardware and software solutions. Creative customers utilize the Companys products for a variety of creative activities including digital video and film production and editing; digital video and film special effects, compositing, and titling; digital still photography and workflow management; graphic design, publishing, and print production; music creation and production; audio production and sound design; and web design, development, and administration. The Company designs its high-end hardware solutions, including servers, desktops, and portable Macintosh systems, to incorporate the power, expandability, and features desired by creative professionals. The Companys operating system, Mac OS X, incorporates powerful graphics and audio technologies and features developer tools to optimize system and application performance when running powerful creative solutions provided by the Company or third-party developers. The Company also offers various software solutions to meet the needs of its creative customers. Business Organization The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America.

Macintosh Computers In June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its Macintosh computers.

This market continues to be characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers and have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price, feature, and performance characteristics. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense. The Companys competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. The principal competitive factors in the market for personal computers include price, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Companys existing products. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of innovations from competing platforms. The Companys future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms. The Companys services and products relating to music and other creative content have already encouraged significant competition from other companies, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, and manufacturing resources than those of the Company. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products and distribution services, subscription services, and free peer-to-peer music services. The Company anticipates that competition will intensify as hardware, software, and content providers work more collaboratively to offer integrated products competing with the Companys offerings. However, the Company believes it currently maintains a competitive advantage by more effectively integrating an entire solution, including the hardware (iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of third-party digital content (iTunes Music Store). Raw Materials Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components  13    obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company did experience such delays during 2004 and 2005 related to PowerPC G5 processors, which resulted in the constrained availability of certain products. The Companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. In June 2005, the Company announced its intention to transition its Macintosh computers using the PowerPC G5 and G4 microprocessors, which are currently single-sourced, to Intel microprocessors by the end of calendar year 2007. The announcement of this transition may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services, including PowerPC G5 and G4 microprocessors. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys business and financial position. At this time, such vendors include Agere Systems, Inc., Ambit Microsystems Corporation, ASUSTeK Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Broadcom Corporation, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., IBM Corporation, Intel Corporation, International Display Technology, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG. Phillips Co., Ltd., Matsushita, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, NVIDIA Corp., PortalPlayer, Inc., Quanta Computer, Inc., Samsung Electronics, Synaptics, Inc., and Toshiba Corporation. Research and Development Because the personal computer and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, consumer electronic products, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. The Companys research and development expenditures totaled $534 million, $489 million, and $471 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, iPods, peripherals and software. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for Apple, the Apple logo, Macintosh, iPod, iTunes, iTunes Music Store, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the  14    ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel. Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third-parties. Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data The U.S. represents the Companys largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 60% of the Companys net sales in 2005 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Companys manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Companys products and final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and iPods are performed by third-party vendors in China. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data. Seasonal Business The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys future net sales or financial performance. Warranty The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most of the Companys hardware products in all of its major markets. Backlog In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 15    Environmental Laws Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member states, Japan, and California. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Employees As of September 24, 2005, the Company had approximately 14,800 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,020 temporary employees and contractors.

This, along with its products original industrial designs, intuitive ease-of-use, built-in graphics, multimedia and networking capabilities, uniquely positions the Company to offer innovative integrated digital lifestyle solutions. 7    Expanded Distribution The Company believes a high-quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons that can convey the value of the Companys products and services greatly enhances its ability to attract and retain customers. The Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Macintosh computer and other products over those of its competitors. The Company has significantly increased the points of distribution for the iPod product family in order to make its products available at locations where its customers shop. By the end of fiscal 2006, the Company had opened a total of 165 retail stores, including 147 stores in the U.S. and a total of 18 stores in Canada, Japan, and the U.K. The Company opened 5 additional stores in October and November 2006. The Company has typically located its stores at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. One of the goals of the retail initiative is to bring new customers to the Company and expand its installed base through sales to computer users who currently do not own a Macintosh computer and first time personal computer buyers. By operating its own stores and building them in desirable high-traffic locations, the Company is able to better control the customer retail experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of personal computers and related products. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes in order to accommodate market demands. The stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice and certain hardware support services. The stores offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software, and various other computing products and supplies selected to complement the Companys own products.

The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2006, 2005, or 2004. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its own sales force and retail and online stores. Ten percent of the Companys net sales in 2006 were through its U.S. education channel, including sales to elementary and secondary schools, higher education institutions, and individual customers. Competition The Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The markets for consumer electronics, personal computers and related software and peripheral products are highly competitive. These markets are characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers and other digital electronic devices and have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price, feature, and performance characteristics. Over the past several years, price competition in these markets have been particularly intense. The Companys competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. The principal competitive factors include price, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Companys existing products. The Companys music products and services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services. The Company believes it currently retains a competitive advantage from innovation and by more effectively integrating the entire solution including the hardware (personal computer and iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of content (iTunes Store). However, the Company expects competition in this space to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to tightly integrate these components within their individual offerings or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more integrated than those they currently offer. Some of these current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings. The Companys future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on the Companys ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform and to the Companys hardware, software and services related to digital content to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms. Raw Materials Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components uncommon to the rest of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by  17    the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys business and financial position. At this time, such vendors include Agere Systems, Inc., Ambit Microsystems Corporation, Amperex Technology Limited, ASUSTeK Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Atheros Communications Inc., AU Optronics Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Intel Corporation, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG. Phillips Co., Ltd., Matsushita, NVIDIA Corp., PortalPlayer, Inc., Quanta Computer, Inc., Renesas Semiconductor Co. Ltd., Samsung Electronics, Sony Corporation, Synaptics, Inc., Texas Instruments, and Toshiba Corporation. Research and Development Because the personal computer and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, consumer electronic products, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. The Companys research and development expenditures totaled $712 million, $535 million (as restated(1)), and $491 million (as restated(1)) in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, iPods, peripherals, software, and services. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for Apple, the Apple logo, Macintosh, iPod, iTunes, iTunes Store, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel.  (1)          See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 18    Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third-parties. Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data The U.S. represents the Companys largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 60% of the Companys net sales in 2006 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is currently performed in the Companys manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California; Fullerton, California; Taiwan; the Republic of Korea; the Peoples Republic of China; and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacturing of many of the components used in the Companys products is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products, including MacBook Pros, MacBooks, and iPods, is performed by third-party vendors in China. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data. Seasonal Business The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys future net sales or financial performance. Warranty The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most of the Companys hardware products in all of its major markets. Backlog In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as dealers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 19     Environmental Laws Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. Employees As of September 30, 2006, the Company had 17,787 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,399 temporary equivalent employees and contractors.

The Company has typically located its stores at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts.  A goal of the Companys retail business is to expand its installed base through sales to customers who currently do not already own the Companys products. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations, the Company is better positioned to control the customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes in order to accommodate market-specific demands. The stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service, and training. The stores offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software, and various other accessory products and peripherals selected to complement the Companys own products.  Education  Throughout its history, the Company has focused on the use of technology in education and has been committed to delivering tools to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement, especially when used to support collaboration, information access, and the expression and representation of student thoughts and ideas. The Company has designed a range of products and services to address the needs of education customers. These products and services include the Companys Mac computers, iPods, and iTunes, in addition to various solutions for video creation and editing, wireless networking, professional development, and one-to-one (1:1) learning.

The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, and cataloguers. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2008, 2007, or 2006. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its own sales force and retail and online stores.  Competition  The Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The markets for consumer electronics, personal computers, related software and peripheral products, digital music devices and related services, and mobile communication devices are highly competitive. These markets are characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers, other digital electronic devices, and mobile communication devices that have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price, feature, and performance characteristics. Over the past several years, price competition in these markets has been particularly intense. The Companys competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. The principal competitive factors include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software and peripherals, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete with the Companys products.  The Companys music products and services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services. The Company believes it currently retains a competitive advantage by offering superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (personal computer, iPod, and iPhone), software (iTunes), and distribution of content (iTunes Store and iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store). However, the Company expects competition in this space to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to tightly integrating these elements within their own offerings or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more integrated than those they currently offer. Some of these current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.  The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to mobile communication devices including the iPhone. The mobile communications industry is highly competitive with several large, well-funded, and experienced competitors. The Company faces competition from mobile communication device companies that may attempt to imitate some of the iPhones functions and applications within their own smart phones. This industry is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.  The Companys future financial condition and operating results are substantially dependent on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of its markets.  Raw Materials  Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including, but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for     9    Table of Contents  the supply of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results.  The Company and other participants in the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured. If the Companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.  Significant portions of the Companys Mac computers, iPods, iPhones, logic boards, and other assembled products are manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Companys outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Companys key products, including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable Mac computers, iPods, iPhones and most of the Companys iMacs. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.  The Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys business and financial condition. At this time, such vendors include, without limitation, Amperex Technology Limited, ASUSTeK Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Atheros Communications Inc., AU Optronics Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Infineon Technologies AG, Intel Corporation, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG Display, LSI Corporation, Matsushita, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., National Semiconductor Corporation, NVIDIA Corp., Inc., Quanta Computer, Inc., Renesas Semiconductor Co. Ltd., Samsung Electronics, Sony Corporation, Synaptics, Inc., Texas Instruments, and Toshiba Corporation.  Research and Development  Because the personal computer, consumer electronics, and mobile communication industries are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of computer hardware and peripherals, consumer electronics products, mobile communication devices, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and Internet services and solutions. The Company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. The Companys research and development expenditures totaled $1.1 billion, $782 million, and $712 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.    10    Table of Contents Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, iPods, iPhone, peripherals, software, and services. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for Apple, the Apple logo, Macintosh, Mac, iPod, iTunes, iTunes Store, iPhone, Apple TV, MobileMe and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel.  The Company regularly files patent applications to protect inventions arising from its research and development, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a portfolio of several thousand issued patents in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, the Company currently holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of the applicable patents that it has been granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. Due to the fast pace of innovation and product development, the Companys products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted.  Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer, digital music player and mobile communications industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data  The U.S. represents the Companys largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 57% of the Companys net sales in 2008 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of the Companys products is currently performed in the Companys manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by external vendors in California, the Republic of Korea (Korea), the Peoples Republic of China (China) and the Czech Republic. Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the U.S., China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Singapore. Sole-sourced third-party vendors in China perform final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products, including MacBook Pro, MacBook, MacBook Air, iPods, iPhone, and most of the Companys iMacs. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, Segment Information and Geographic Data.  Seasonal Business  The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty  The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products, including Mac computers, iPods and iPhones. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the     11    Table of Contents  original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products in most of its major markets.  Backlog  In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as dealers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.  Environmental Laws  Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces, and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or operating results.  Employees  As of September 27, 2008, the Company had approximately 32,000 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 3,100 temporary equivalent employees and contractors.

These options include assistance that is built into software products, printed and electronic product manuals, online support including comprehensive product information as well as technical assistance, and the AppleCare Protection Plan. The AppleCare Protection Plan is a fee-based service that typically includes two to three years of phone support and hardware repairs, dedicated web-based support resources, and user diagnostic tools.  Markets and Distribution  The Companys customers are primarily in the consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government and creative markets. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2009, 2008 or 2007. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its own sales force and retail and online stores.  Competition  The Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The markets for personal computers, mobile communication devices, consumer electronics, related software, services and peripheral products are highly competitive. These markets are characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other digital electronic devices that have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price, feature, and performance characteristics. Over the past several years, price competition in these markets has been particularly intense. The Companys competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. The principal competitive factors include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software and peripherals, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete with the Companys products.  The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to mobile communication devices including the iPhone. The mobile communications industry is highly competitive and includes several large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in the mobile communication industry to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the iPhones functionality and applications within their own smart phones or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. This industry is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.  The Companys music products and services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services. The Company believes it currently retains a competitive advantage by offering superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (personal computer, iPhone and iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of digital content and applications (iTunes Store, iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store and App Store). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings. Alternatively, these competitors may collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more integrated than those they currently offer.    9    Table of Contents The Companys future financial condition and operating results are substantially dependent on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets it competes in.  Raw Materials  Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.  The Company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.  Significant portions of the Companys Mac computers, iPhones, iPods, logic boards and other assembled products are manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Companys outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Companys key products, including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable Mac computers, iPhones, iPods and most of the Companys desktop products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.  The Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company if they were to encounter financial distress or become insolvent, incur capacity or supply constraints, become unable to obtain credit, or for any other reason could materially adversely affect the Companys business and financial condition. At this time, such vendors include, without limitation, 3M Co., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., AKM Semiconductor Inc., Amkor Technology Inc., Analog Devices Inc., Aptina Imaging Corp., ARM Holdings PLC., Atheros Communications Inc., Atmel Corp., AU Optronics Corp., Avago Technologies Ltd.,    10    Table of Contents  Broadcom Corp., Cirrus Logic Inc., Corning Inc., Cypress Semiconductor Corp., Dover Corp., Flextronics Inc., Foxconn Technology Co.

Ltd., Texas Instruments Inc., Toshiba Corp., Toyoda Gosei Co. Ltd., and TriQuint Semiconductor Inc.  Research and Development  Because the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of computer hardware and peripherals, mobile communication devices, consumer electronics products, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and Internet services and solutions. The Company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and acquisition of third-party business and technology. The Companys research and development expenditures totaled $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $782 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, iPhone and iPod devices, peripherals, software and services. In addition, the Company has registered and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for Apple, the Apple logo, Macintosh, Mac, iPhone, iPod, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple TV, MobileMe and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.  The Company regularly files patent applications to protect inventions arising from its research and development, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a portfolio of several thousand issued patents in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, the Company currently holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of the applicable patents it has been granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. Due to the fast pace of innovation and product development, the Companys products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted.  Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer, digital music player and mobile communications industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.    11    Table of Contents Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data  The U.S. represents the Companys largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 54% of the Companys net sales in 2009 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of the Companys products is currently performed in the Companys manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by external vendors in California, Texas, the Peoples Republic of China (China), the Czech Republic and the Republic of Korea (Korea). Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the U.S., China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Sole-sourced third-party vendors in China perform final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable Mac products, iPhone, iPods and most of the Companys desktop products. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 and Item 8 of this Form 10-K and in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, Segment Information and Geographic Data.  Seasonal Business  The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty  The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products, including Mac computers, iPhones and iPods. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products in most of its major markets.  Backlog  In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as dealers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.  Environmental Laws  Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, compliance with environmental laws could materially adversely affect the Company.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various countries within Europe and Asia and certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition or operating results.    12    Table of Contents Employees  As of September 26, 2009, the Company had approximately 34,300 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,500 full-time equivalent temporary employees and contractors.

In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPhone, iPad and iPod compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals, through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB), education, enterprise, government and creative markets. The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented in this Form 10-K is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. The Company is a California corporation founded in 1977.  Business Strategy  The Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, services, and Internet offerings. The Companys business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to the development and enhancement of innovative products and technologies. In conjunction with its strategy, the Company continues to build and host a robust platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store. The iTunes Store includes the App Store and iBookstore, which allow customers to discover and download third-party applications and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or wirelessly through an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. The Company also works to support a community for the development of third-party software and hardware products and digital content that complement the Companys offerings. Additionally, the Companys strategy includes expanding its distribution to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle and productivity solutions.    1    Table of Contents   Consumer and Small and Mid-Sized Business  The Company believes a high-quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Companys products and services greatly enhances its ability to attract and retain customers. The Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and businesses through its retail and online stores. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.  As of September 25, 2010, the Company had opened a total of 317 retail stores, including 233 stores in the U.S. and 84 stores internationally. The Company has typically located its stores at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations, the Company is better positioned to control the customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes to accommodate market-specific demands. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors. The stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training. The stores offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software, and various other accessories and peripherals that complement the Companys products.  Education  Throughout its history, the Company has focused on the use of technology in education and has been committed to delivering tools to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement, especially when used to support collaboration, information access, and the expression and representation of student thoughts and ideas. The Company has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers, including individual laptop programs and education road shows. In addition, the Company supports mobile learning and real-time distribution and accessibility of education related materials through iTunes U, which allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media directly through their computers and mobile communication and media devices. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its online and retail stores.  Enterprise, Government and Creative  The Company also sells its hardware and software products to customers in enterprise, government and creative markets in each of its geographic segments. These markets are also important to many third-party developers who provide Mac-compatible hardware and software solutions.

Other Application Software  The Company also sells various other application software, including Final Cut Studio, Final Cut Express, Final Cut Server, Logic Studio, Logic Express 9, Logic Studio Pro, and its FileMaker Pro database software.

Markets and Distribution  The Companys customers are primarily in the consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government and creative markets. The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on its products, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the Company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.    6    Table of Contents   One of the Companys customers accounted for 11% of net sales in 2009; there was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2010 or 2008.  Competition  The Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers, mobile communication and media devices, and other digital electronic devices. The Companys competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. The principal competitive factors include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software and peripherals, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.  The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to mobile communication and media devices, including iPhone and iPad. The mobile communications and media device industries are highly competitive and include several large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these industries to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the iPhone and iPad features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These industries are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.  The Companys iPod and digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (personal computer, iPhone, iPad and iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of digital content and applications (iTunes Store, App Store and iBookstore). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings. Alternatively, these competitors may collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more integrated than those they currently offer.  The Companys future financial condition and operating results are substantially dependent on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets it competes in.  Supply of Components  Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.    7    Table of Contents   The Company and other participants in the personal computer, and mobile communication and media device industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.  Substantially all of the Companys Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods, logic boards and other assembled products are manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few outsourcing partners of the Company, including Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd. and Quanta Computer, Inc. The Companys outsourced manufacturing is often performed in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Companys key products, including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Companys Macs, iPhones, iPads and iPods. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.  The Company sources components from a number of suppliers and manufacturing vendors. The loss of supply from any of these suppliers or vendors, whether temporary or permanent, could materially adversely affect the Companys business and financial condition. Research and Development  Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products that expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and acquisition of third-party business and technology. Total research and development expense was $1.8 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its Macs, iPhone, iPad and iPod devices, peripherals, software and services. In addition, the Company has registered and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for Apple, the Apple logo, Macintosh, Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple TV, MobileMe and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.  The Company regularly files patent applications to protect inventions arising from its research and development, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a portfolio of several thousand issued patents in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, the Company currently holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is    8    Table of Contents  solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of the applicable patents it has been granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. Due to the fast pace of innovation and product development, the Companys products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted.  Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data  The U.S. represents the Companys largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 44% of the Companys net sales in 2010 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of the Companys products is currently performed in the Companys manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by external vendors in California, Texas, the Peoples Republic of China (China), the Czech Republic and the Republic of Korea (Korea). Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the U.S., China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Sole-sourced third-party vendors in China perform final assembly of substantially all of the Companys Macs, iPhones, iPads and iPods. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 and Item 8 of this Form 10-K and in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, Segment Information and Geographic Data.  Seasonal Business  The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand of consumer markets related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year; however, this pattern has been less pronounced following the introductions of iPhone and iPad. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty  The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products, including Macs, iPhones, iPads and iPods. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase the APP, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products in most of its major markets.  Backlog  In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as dealers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.    9    Table of Contents   Environmental Laws  Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no significant effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, compliance with environmental laws could materially adversely affect the Company.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various countries within Europe and Asia and certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition or operating results.  Employees  As of September 25, 2010, the Company had approximately 46,600 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,800 full-time equivalent temporary employees and contractors.  Available Information  The Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise, integration and support services.  The Companys retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations, the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes to accommodate market-specific demands. The Company believes providing direct contact with its customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors.

The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution and accessibility of education related materials through iTunes UTM, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its online and retail stores.  Enterprise and Government  The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its geographic segments. The Companys products are deployed in these markets because of their power, productivity, ease of use and the simplicity of seamless integration into information technology environments. The Companys products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration.  Business Organization  The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company has determined that its reportable operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail. The results of the Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific reportable segments do not include the results of the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than Japan.

The Company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the Company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2011 or 2010. One of the Companys customers accounted for 11% of net sales in 2009.  Competition  The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and other digital electronic devices. The Companys competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and peripherals ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.  The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to mobile communication and media devices. These industries are highly competitive and include several large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these industries to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These industries are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.  The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of digital content and applications (iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore and Mac App Store). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.  The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets it competes in.    6    Supply of Components  Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.  The Company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device, and personal computer industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.  Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturer for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods up to 150 days. Research and Development  Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through research and development, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Total research and development expense was $2.4 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod devices, peripherals, software and services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.    7    The Company regularly files patent applications to protect inventions arising from its research and development, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents in the U.S. and worldwide. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. Due to the fast pace of innovation and product development, the Companys products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted.  Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, based upon past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data  The U.S. represents the Companys largest geographic market. Approximately 39% of the Companys net sales in 2011 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of the Companys products is currently performed in the Companys manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by outsourcing partners, primarily located in Asia. The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Single-sourced outsourcing partners in Asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 and Item 8 of this Form 10-K and in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 8, Segment Information and Geographic Data.  Seasonal Business  The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to increased holiday seasonal demand. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty  The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase the APP, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products in most of its major markets.  Backlog  In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers    8     believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.  Employees  As of September 24, 2011, the Company had approximately 60,400 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,900 full-time equivalent temporary employees and contractors.  Available Information  The Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

The Companys strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience.    1    Table of Contents Consumer and Small and Mid-Sized Business  The Company believes a high-quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Companys products and services greatly enhances its ability to attract and retain customers. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and SMBs through its retail and online stores. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise, integration and support services.  The Companys retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes to accommodate market-specific demands. The Company believes providing direct contact with its customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors.

The Company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the Company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2012, 2011 or 2010.  Competition  The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and other digital electronic devices. The Companys competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and peripherals ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.  The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include several large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.  The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services.  The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod), software (iTunes), online services (iCloud), and distribution of digital content and applications (iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore and Mac App Store). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.    6    Table of Contents Supply of Components  Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.  The Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.  Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. Research and Development  Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through research and development, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Total research and development expense was $3.4 billion, $2.4 billion, and $1.8 billion in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod devices, peripherals, software and services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.  The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company    7    Table of Contents  has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents in the U.S. and worldwide. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.  Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data  During 2012, the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 39% and 61%, respectively, of total net sales. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance, and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 8, Segment Information and Geographic Data.  Final assembly of the Companys products is currently performed in the Companys manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Outsourcing partners in Asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.  Seasonal Business  The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to holiday seasonal demand. Actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions by the Company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the Company in any particular quarter. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty  The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or APP+, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products.  Backlog  In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately    8    Table of Contents  following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.  Employees  As of September 29, 2012, the Company had approximately 72,800 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 3,300 full-time equivalent temporary employees and contractors. Approximately 42,400 of the total full-time equivalent employees worked in the Companys Retail segment.

AC+ is a fee-based service available in certain countries for iPhone and iPad. AC+ offers additional coverage under some circumstances for instances of accidental damage in addition to the services offered by APP.  Markets and Distribution  The Companys customers are primarily in the consumer, SMB, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and SMBs through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. During 2013, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 30% and 70%, respectively, of total net sales. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.  To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Companys retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software, and other accessories and peripherals that complement the Companys products.  The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise, integration and support services.  The Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education related materials through iTunes U, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its online and retail stores.    5    Table of Contents The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its geographic segments. The Companys products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease of use and seamless integration into information technology environments. The Companys products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration.  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2013, 2012 or 2011.  Competition  The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and other digital electronic devices. The Companys competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and peripherals ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.  The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.  The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services.  The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod), software (iOS, OS X and iTunes), online services, and distribution of digital content and applications (iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store and Mac App Store). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.  Supply of Components  Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results.    6    Table of Contents The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.  The Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.  While the Company has announced plans to begin manufacturing some Macs in the United States, substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. Research and Development  Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through research and development, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Total research and development expense was $4.5 billion, $3.4 billion and $2.4 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod devices, peripherals, software and services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.  The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents in the U.S. and worldwide. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.    7    Table of Contents Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Companys products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data  During 2013, the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 39% and 61%, respectively, of total net sales. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance, and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data.  While substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, the Company also performs final assembly of certain products at its manufacturing facility in Ireland. The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies.  Business Seasonality and Product Introductions  The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty  The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products.  Backlog  In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.    8    Table of Contents Employees  As of September 28, 2013, the Company had approximately 80,300 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 4,100 full-time equivalent temporary employees and contractors. Approximately 42,800 of the total full-time equivalent employees worked in the Companys Retail segment.

Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 4    Table of Contents Product Support and Services  AppleCare offers a range of support options for the Companys customers. These include assistance that is built into software products, printed and electronic product manuals, online support including comprehensive product information as well as technical assistance, the AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) and the AppleCare+ Protection Plan (AC+). APP is a fee-based service that typically includes two to three years of phone support, hardware repairs and dedicated web-based support resources.

AC+ offers additional coverage under some circumstances for instances of accidental damage in addition to the services offered by APP.  Markets and Distribution  The Companys customers are primarily in the consumer, SMB, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and SMBs through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. During 2014, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 28% and 72%, respectively, of total net sales. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.  To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Companys retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software and other accessories that complement the Companys products.  The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high-quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise, integration and support services.  The Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education related materials through iTunes U, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its online and retail stores.  The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its geographic segments. The Companys products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease of use and seamless integration into information technology environments. The Companys products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration. In July 2014, the Company announced a global partnership with IBM to offer MobileFirst for iOS, a new class of industry-specific mobile solutions; AppleCare for Enterprise, a new service and support product tailored to the needs of enterprise customers; and Device Supply, Activate and Manage, a suite of value-added reselling services for iPhone, iPad and Mac.  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2014, 2013 or 2012.    Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 5    Table of Contents Competition  The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. The Companys competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.  The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.  The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services.  The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod), software (iOS, OS X and iTunes), online services and distribution of digital content and applications (iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store and Mac App Store). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.  Supply of Components  Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results.  The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.  The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.    Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 6    Table of Contents While the Company manufactures some Macs in the United States, substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. Research and Development  Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through R&D, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Total R&D expense was $6.0 billion, $4.5 billion and $3.4 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.  The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.  Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Companys products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data  During 2014, the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance, and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data.  While substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, the Company also performs final assembly of certain products at its manufacturing facility in Ireland. The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies.    Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 7    Table of Contents Business Seasonality and Product Introductions  The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty  The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In certain jurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute, typically at least two years. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products.  Backlog  In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.  Employees  As of September 27, 2014, the Company had approximately 92,600 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 4,400 full-time equivalent temporary employees and contractors. Approximately 46,200 of the total full-time equivalent employees worked in the Companys Retail segment.

As of September 27, 2014, $67.9 billion of the $90 billion had been utilized. The remaining $22.1 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of September 27, 2014. The Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.

All developers also have access to extensive technical documentation and sample code.  Markets and Distribution  The Companys customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. During 2015, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 26% and 74%, respectively, of total net sales. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.  To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Companys retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software and other accessories that complement the Companys products.    Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 4    Table of Contents The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high-quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise, integration and support services.  The Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education related materials through iTunes U, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its online and retail stores.  The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its reportable operating segments. The Companys products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease of use and seamless integration into information technology environments. The Companys products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration.  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2015, 2014 or 2013.  Competition  The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. The Companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features (including security features), relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.  The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.  The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services.  The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software (iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content and applications (Internet Services). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.  Supply of Components  Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results.    Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 5    Table of Contents The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and the Company often utilizes custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of components were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.  The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.  While some Mac computers are manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. Research and Development  Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through R&D, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Total R&D expense was $8.1 billion, $6.0 billion and $4.5 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.  The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.  Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Companys products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data  During 2015, the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 35% and 65%, respectively, of total net sales. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance, and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data.    Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 6    Table of Contents While some Mac computers are manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies.  Business Seasonality and Product Introductions  The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty  The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In certain jurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute, typically at least two years. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products.  Backlog  In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.  Employees  As of September 26, 2015, the Company had approximately 110,000 full-time equivalent employees.

The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. During 2016, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 25% and 75%, respectively, of total net sales.The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Companys retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software and other accessories that complement the Companys products.The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high-quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations.

The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education related materials through iTunes U, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its retail and online stores.The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its reportable operating segments. The Companys products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease of use and seamless integration into information technology environments. The Companys products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration.No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 4CompetitionThe markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. The Companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features (including security features), relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services.The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software (iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content and applications (Internet Services). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.Supply of ComponentsAlthough most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and the Company often utilizes custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of components were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.While some Mac computers are manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 5Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through R&D, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Total R&D expense was $10.0 billion, $8.1 billion and $6.0 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and LicensesThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Companys products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic DataDuring 2016, the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 35% and 65%, respectively, of total net sales. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance, and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data.While some Mac computers are manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies.Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.WarrantyThe Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In certain jurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute, typically at least two years. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 6BacklogIn the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.EmployeesAs of September 24, 2016, the Company had approximately 116,000 full-time equivalent employees.Available InformationThe Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

In exchange for an up-front payment of $3.0 billion, the financial institution party to the arrangement committed to deliver shares to the Company during the ASRs purchase period, which will end in or before November 2016. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume weighted-average price of the Companys common stock during that period.
